!!! note "Important information regarding the demonstration environment!"

    In this demonstration environment, full access to the IBM Cloud account is NOT provided. Provisioning a IBM Cloud® Security and Compliance Center Workload Protection (SCC WP) is not permitted within this environment. The following activity offers an overview of the SCC WP and includes links for further information.

IBM Cloud® Security and Compliance Center Workload Protection (SCC WP) offers a comprehensive suite of security solutions to help your organization secure its cloud environments. Security and Compliance Center Workload Protection centrally manages your organization’s security, risk, and compliance with regulatory standards and industry benchmarks. 

In highly regulated sectors such as financial services, continuous compliance in the cloud environment is crucial to protect customer and application data. Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) is one of the key features of the Security and Compliance Center Workload Protection service. When this feature is enabled, the CSPM ensures that automatic compliance checks are integrated in your development workflow to mitigate such risks on a daily basis.

CSPM helps with:

  - Continuous validation of compliance
  - Vulnerability prioritization
  - Detection and response to runtime threats
  - Forensics and incident response

Clients can enable the CSPM feature in their new and existing Power Virtual Server workspaces. CSPM provides a unified platform to manage security and compliance across hybrid and multicloud environments and services.

After provisioning an instance of the Security and Compliance Center Workload Protection service in IBM Cloud, clients can deploy the Workload Protection agent on their Linux or AIX hosts on IBM® Power® Virtual Server (PowerVS). Workload Protection provides the following features to protect their stand-alone Linux or AIX hosts on Power Virtual Server:

  - Posture management
  - Host scanning
  - Threat detection and response
