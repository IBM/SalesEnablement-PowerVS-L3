The Backup Offering is powered by Cobalt Iron Compass and is accessible from the IBM Cloud catalog. By ordering from the IBM Cloud Catalog, IBM Power Virtual Server customers get a simple, secure, and automated backup and restore experience that turns on within minutes of ordering. 

Secure Automated Backup with Compass automates all operational tasks and complexities, allowing customers to protect their data quickly and securely.
