!!! note "Important information regarding the demonstration environment!"

    In this demonstration environment, full access to the IBM Cloud account is NOT provided. Provisioning a DR automation service is not permitted within this environment. The following activity offers an overview of the DR automation and includes links for further information.

IBM Power Virtual Server DR Automation® simplifies disaster recovery by automating the recovery of virtual machines, leveraging IBM Cloud infrastructure to offer a flexible, scalable, and efficient DR process. DR Automation provides a single interface to manage DR processes for IBM PowerVS environments. Use DR Automation to ensure the continuity of operations with minimal manual intervention.

Key features include:

  - **Automated failover and failback**: Automate the failover process, ensuring that workloads resume quickly in the backup environment.
  - **Monitoring and recovery**: Monitor the health and status of DR sites.
  - **Customizable recovery settings**: Define recovery priorities and configurations for different VMs.

Deploy DR Automation from the IBM Cloud Catalog UI, which provides an intuitive interface for selecting and configuring recovery services. The solution automates the recovery of virtual machines (VMs) and workloads, synchronizing data and managing replication between sites to protect critical operations.

IBM Power Virtual Server Public Cloud officially supports Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), IBM i, and IBM AIX® operating systems for creating virtual servers and configuring them as managed virtual machines to enable DR. 

With robust automation, DR Automation minimizes downtime, reduces manual tasks, and enhances business resilience.
