!!! note "Important information regarding the demonstration environment!"

    In this demonstration environment, full access to the IBM Cloud account is NOT provided. Provisioning a SAP or SAP HANA on Power Virtual Server (PowerVS) is not permitted within this environment. The following activity offers an overview of the RISE with SAP on PowerVS capability and includes links for further information.

For over half a century, enterprises have used IBM's infrastructure to host their mission-critical SAP systems, for round-the-clock operations while safeguarding sensitive business data.

RISE with SAP helps clients modernize their ERP landscape and migrate it to the cloud. It combines outcome-driven services, cloud ERP on SAP S/4HANA® and other key platforms that can help transform the enterprise operating model. However, transitioning to a cloud ERP solution can be complex. 

To help accelerate client's move to cloud ERP, SAP® will offer RISE with SAP on IBM® Power® Virtual Server. IBM Power Virtual Server (PowerVS) offers a unique advantage to these enterprises: It is designed to let them migrate to RISE with SAP with less disruption by keeping their applications and databases on the same hardware architecture they currently use. This helps them execute a swift transition to RISE with SAP and be on a highly resilient and secured cloud platform.

Because multi-model, in-memory databases like SAP HANA place high demands on underlying infrastructure, running SAP HANA on powerful, reliable servers is essential to achieving optimum performance. Created to support data-intensive workloads, IBM Power® provides an outstanding platform for SAP HANA, is certified by SAP, and offers key business advantages.

By running SAP HANA on IBM Power servers, enterprises can also significantly strengthen business continuity and protect against downtime. In its latest Server OS Reliability Report, Information Technology Intelligence Consulting (ITIC) discovered that 91 percent of all IBM Power servers they tested delivered 99.999 percent reliability[<sup>1</sup>](https://itic-corp.com/itic-2021-global-server-hardware-server-os-reliability-survey-results/){target="_blank"}. And in its most recent Server OS Security Report, ITIC found that IBM Power customers reported an average downtime of less than 3.3 minutes over a 12-month period[<sup>2</sup>](https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/signup?formid=urx-50805){target="_blank"}.

This level of rock-solid reliability has made IBM Power a staple for every organization that drives its critical business processes with SAP HANA.
