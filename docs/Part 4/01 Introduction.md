Via the IBM Cloud Portal, clients can control and manage many aspects of their PowerVS deployment.

On a per PowerVS instance (VM) basis, using the IBM Cloud Portal or IBM Cloud Portal application programming interfaces (APIs) clients can (not all options are available for all operating systems):

   - Perform an OS shutdown
   - Perform an immediate shutdown (without killing processes)
   - Restart
   - Reset
   - Open an instance console
   - Delete the instance
   - Capture and export an image of the instance

In addition, some instances can be modified.  Depending on core type, operating system, etc., a client can:

   - Change VM pinning (soft, hard)
   - Change core type (Shared uncapped, Shared capped, Dedicated)
   - Change number of cores
   - Change amount of RAM
   - Change placement group

And it is possible to attach and detach storage volumes and attach an instance to an existing network.

In the next chapter, explore some of the options listed above for managing PowerVS instances.
