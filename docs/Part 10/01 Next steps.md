This Level 3 demonstration guide showed how easy it is to provision resources with IBM Power Virtual Server (PowerVS). Users learned the basics for managing PowerVS resources. But there is still more to learn about PowerVS. Links to specific PowerVS topics were provided throughout this demonstration guide. Take the time to read the official <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/power-iaas" target="_blank">PowerVS documentation</a> to learn the full capabilities of the offering.

Finally, remember to complete the IBM Power Systems Virtual Server - Level 3 learning plan.

**IBMers** sales must complete a Stand and Deliver exercise to validate their ability to demonstrate PowerVS to potential clients. Refer to the evaluation rubric in the learning plan to prepare your Stand and Deliver.

**Business Partners** must pass the PowerVS quiz from learn.ibm.com. Remember, take the quiz while the reservation to the TechZone environment is active. The Business Partner quiz verifies use of the demonstration environment and not general knowledge of the PowerVS offering.
