In this chapter, watch a video of an {{offering.name}} **instance** being provisioned using the IBM Cloud Portal.

The video has been edited to minimize the viewing time and does not reflect the actual provisioning time of a PowerVS **instance**. The actual provisioning time will vary, but it is typically less than 5 minutes. This video includes audio that explains the steps being taken and things to consider while making choices on options. This video can be utilized for client demonstrations either with or without the audio.

Included in this video is the creation of the SSH keys to secure initial administrative (root) access to the virtual machine. Demonstrating this process to clients should be considered optional depending on the audience.
