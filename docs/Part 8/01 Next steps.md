In this demonstration guide, you learned how easy it is to provision resources with {{offering.name}} (PowerVS). You also learned some of the basics for managing PowerVS resources. But there is still more to learn about PowerVS. Links to specific PowerVS topics were provided throughout this demonstration guide. If you haven't already, take the time to read the <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/power-iaas" target="_blank">PowerVS documentation<a/> to learn the full capabilities of the offering.

Finally, remember to complete the {{learningplan.name}} learning plan.

**IBM Sales** and **IBM Technical sales** must complete a Stand and Deliver exercise to demonstrate to your manager your newly learned ability to demonstrate PowerVS. Be sure to refer to the evaluation rubric in the learning plan when preparing your Stand and Deliver demonstration.

**Business Partners** must pass the PowerVS quiz in learn.ibm.com. Remember, you will want to take the quiz while you have access to the TechZone environment. The BP quiz questions verify your use of the demonstration environment and not necessarily your knowledge of PowerVS.
