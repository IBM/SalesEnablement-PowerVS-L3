**IBM Power Systems Virtual Server** (PowerVS) delivers flexible compute capacity for Power Systems workloads. Integrated with the IBM Cloud platform for on-demand provisioning, this offering provides a secure and scalable server virtualization environment built upon the advanced RAS features and leading performance of the Power Systems platform.

You should be familiar with PowerVS and should have completed the IBM Power Systems Virtual Server Sales Foundation Badge (Level 2) before embarking on the Level 3 content. The content here is **not** a replacement for the Level 1 and 2 content that is part of the previous learning plans, which are linked in the documentation accompanying this course.

This demonstration environment has multiple purposes. First, it is meant to educate you on IBM Power Systems Virtual Server (PowerVS) and to hone your skills to perform PowerVS demonstrations. Additionally, the IBM Technology Zone (TechZone) environment, this demonstration guide and associated click-thru demos and videos can be re-used to perform client demonstrations.

Primarily, our goal is to focus on the Infrastructure as a Service capability of PowerVS and not on the operating systems supported by the offering: AIX, IBM i, and Linux. Throughout the course, you will:

- In **Parts 1, 2, and 3**, learn how the demonstration environment was built, and how to perform a "baking show" style demonstration using the IBM Cloud Portal, click-thru demonstrations, and videos. New PowerVS resources are not provisioned as part of this demonstration guide. All resources are pre-provisioned in a shared environment to save time and money.
- In **Part 4**, learn how to use the IBM Cloud Portal to manage PowerVS instances.
- In **Part 5**, learn how to access the pre-provisioned PowerVS instances using IBM Cloud Shell.
- **Parts 1 through 5** provide a good foundation for performing a high-level, customer facing demonstration of IBM Power Systems Virtual Server.
- **Parts 6 and 7** introduce several more technical aspects of IBM Power Systems Virtual Server including using the PowerVS IBM Cloud command line interface (CLI) plugin.
- Finally, in **Part 8**, learn where to find additional resources about IBM Power Systems Virtual Server, and how to complete the IBM Power Systems Virtual Server - Level 3 badge.
