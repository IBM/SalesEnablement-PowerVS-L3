IBM Power Systems Virtual Server is an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offering. PowerVS allows clients to rapidly provision new virtual server instances (VSIs) with AIX, IBM i, or Linux operating systems(OS). Ultimately, clients want to deploy applications on those VSIs. The applications that clients choose to deploy vary widely. They include middleware like databases, third-party software products like SAP, or in-house applications. To install these applications, they need to access the instance and install the software.

A fundamental challenge that clients face is how to connect their on-premises data sources with off-premises (cloud-based) resources and services. Doing so securely, efficiently, and cost-effectively is undeniably a challenge for organizations of every size, whether they are a mid-sized business or an enterprise company.

Three main methods are:

- Public internet

- Virtual private network (VPN) tunnel

- IBM Cloud Direct Link (2.0)

Usually, clients deploy PowerVS instances that use a secured network like Direct Link or Virtual Private Network (VPN).

**IBM Cloud Direct Link (2.0)** provides a level of trusted connectivity from enterprise sources to a client's IBM Cloud private network. IBM Cloud Direct Link (2.0) is tailored to every client's workload requirements or business use case.

- **Direct Link Connect** is a solution for data center to data center connectivity (between clouds, or between on-premises and cloud), flexible bandwidth requirements, and multicloud environments. It also presents a less costly entry for IBM Cloud network clients compared to other Direct Link offerings.

- **Direct Link Dedicated** is built for clients that have high-volume workloads that require low latency, or for those clients rapidly moving data across multicloud environments. It satisfies stringent compliance requirements that are held by certain countries or industries. Dedicated also supports universal connectivity for either colocation or carrier.

- **Dedicated Hosting** options are also available for clients with nonstandard technologies (requiring bespoke networking solutions). Many such clients need to maintain and continue to use their existing IT investments, as they invest in cloud-based technologies. Dedicated storage options are available in parallel for such clients. The connection point for Dedicated Hosting is next to an IBM Cloud data center to provide optimal latency and performance.

- IBM Cloud **VPN** access allows users to manage all servers remotely and securely over the IBM Cloud private network. A VPN connection from a remote location to the private network gives the capability for out-of-band management and server rescue through an encrypted VPN tunnel.
