Server placement groups provide control over the host or server on which a new instance is placed. By using server placement groups, high availability within a data center can be achieved. When a placement group is set with an affinity policy, all instances in that placement group are launched on the same physical server. When a placement group is set with an anti-affinity policy, all instances in that placement group are launched on different servers.

A few facts about server placement groups:

  - By default, there is a maximum of 25 server placement groups. A support ticket needs to be raised to go beyond this limit.
  - The IBM Cloud Portal for server placement groups can only be used if the cloud account has less than 100 instances. If the account has > 100 instances, the command line interfaces (CLI) or application programming interfaces (API) must be used to create server placement groups.
