**Note**: This feature is applicable for IBM i virtual server instances (VSI) only.<br><br> A virtual serial number (VSN) can be assigned to a VSI to keep track of the installation, support entitlements, and licensing compliance for IBM i software. The VSN has seven digits and it is a unique string. A VSI is moved across systems with its associated VSN. Hence, when a VSN is associated with a VSI you need not pin the VSI to a host for licensing or entitlement purpose. 

1. Click **Virtual serial numbers** (**A**) option in the side menu under the {{powerVS.serviceInstanceName}} workspace. You will see an empty list as the VSN feature is not used in this demonstration. When VSN feature is used, this page will show the VSN, the IBM i VSI associated with the VSN, and the VSN description.

    !!! note "VSN details available on the VSI details page as well"

        The details of a VSN associated with an IBM i VSI can also be seen on the IBM i VSI details page.<br>![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e6b2239-ce92-4e79-bc56-41bc79c1e47c)
