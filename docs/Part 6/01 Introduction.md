Mentioned earlier throughout this Level 3 course are the variety of features available for managing PowerVS instances after the infrastructure and services are deployed. The ability to customize and scale these environments post-provisioning are precisely the *cloud* benefits that draw clients toward an investment in PowerVS. Next, dive deeper into the following advanced topics.

Specifically, explore each of the following categories in turn: 

- Virtual appliances
- Shared processor pools and server placement groups
- SSH keys
- Boot images
- Networking
- Storage volumes
- Event logs
- Additional products and services
