In this exercise, explore several of the PowerVS CLIs. It is important to remember you are using a shared environment and have limited administrative permissions. The CLIs being executed here are command that only require "read" access to the environment. CLIs also exist to create and modify the PowerVS resources, you will just not have sufficient permissions to execute those commands in the shared environment.  Attempting to do so will result in an error.

For this exercise, the IBM Cloud Shell will be used. IBM Cloud Shell gives users complete control of their cloud resources, applications and infrastructure, from any web browser. IBM Cloud Shell provides pre-authenticated access to the latest tools and programming languages for cloud-based development, deployment and management of services and applications â€” all in a secure shell. IBM Cloud Shell is instantly accessible from the IBM Cloud portal. The IBM command line interface (CLI) along with all the IBM Cloud CLI plugins are pre-installed in IBM Cloud Shell, including the PowerVS CLIs.
