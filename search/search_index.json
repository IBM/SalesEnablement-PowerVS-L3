The goal of this demonstration guide is to provide IBM and Business Partner Sales and Technical Sales the knowledge and tools to perform introductory demonstrations of IBM Power Systems Virtual Server (PowerVS). There are 9 parts to this demonstration guide as seen in the left hand navigation. To complete the IBM Power Systems Virtual Server - Level 3 badge requirements, IBM and Business Partner sellers must complete Parts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 9 of this demonstration guide. IBM and Business Partner technical sellers must complete all sections. The associated Learning Plan Stand and Deliver rubrics (IBM) and quizzes (Business Partners) are based upon the sections required for the respective roles. All are welcome and encouraged to complete all sections. Business Partner Tip To complete the IBM Power Systems Virtual Server - Level 3 badge, all Business Partners must complete a 5 question quiz. The quiz is focused on validating completion of this demonstration script, and not general knowledge of PowerVS. It is highly recommended to complete the quiz while the IBM Technology Zone environment is active. Several of the questions ask about specific settings or content that is seen in the IBM Cloud Portal. In Parts 1, 2, and 3, learn how the demonstration environment was built, and how to perform a \"baking show\" style demonstration using the IBM Cloud Portal, click-thru demonstrations, and videos. New PowerVS resources are not provisioned as part of this demonstration guide. All resources are pre-provisioned in a shared environment to save time and money. In Part 4, learn how to use the IBM Cloud Portal to manage PowerVS instances. In Part 5, learn how to access the pre-provisioned PowerVS instances using the IBM Cloud Shell. Parts 1 through 5 provide a good foundation for performing a high-level, customer facing demonstration of IBM Power Systems Virtual Server. Parts 6 through 8 introduce several more technical aspects of IBM Power Systems Virtual Server including using the PowerVS IBM Cloud command line interface (CLI) plugin. Finally, in Part 9, learn where to find additional resources about IBM Power Systems Virtual Server, and how to complete the IBM Power Systems Virtual Server - Level 3 badge. Before jumping to part 1, please read the guidance below. Reading and understanding the information will save time while completing the steps in this guide.

Think of the PowerVS service as a container for all PowerVS instances at a specific geographic region. The service is available from the Resource list in the IBM Cloud Portal. The service can contain multiple instances . For example, you can have two services , one in Dallas, Texas, and another in Washington, D.C. Each service can contain multiple instances . A service must be associated with an IBM Cloud resource group which helps in grouping resources and assigning permissions. To learn more, refer to Getting Started with IBM Power Systems Virtual Server . The key parameters for a PowerVS service are: Datacenter location: As of August 2022, PowerVS is co-located with 15 IBM Cloud datacenters located around the world. When selecting a datacenter, consider choosing the datacenter located nearest the majority of the end users that will be accessing the workloads running in PowerVS. Service name: The PowerVS service name will appear in the IBM Cloud Portal under the provisioned services. Specify a name that is easily understood and recognized. Resource group: Resource groups are used to organize resources in your IBM Cloud account. Administrative and access rights for all PowerVS resources are associated with the PowerVS service and not individual PowerVS instances (VMs). Once a PowerVS service is assigned to a resource group, the resource group can not be changed.

The environment is in its own pod and the internal networks are fenced but offer connectivity options to meet customer requirements. This infrastructure design enables IBM Power Systems Virtual Server to maintain key enterprise software certification and support as the PowerVS architecture is identical to certified on-premises infrastructure. The virtual servers, also known as instances, logical partitions (LPAR), or virtual machines (VMs) run on IBM Power Systems hardware with the PowerVM hypervisor. The key parameters for a PowerVS instance are: Instance name: The PowerVS instance name will appear in the IBM Cloud Portal under the list of instances within a service. Specify a name that is easily understood and recognized. Server placement group: Server placement groups provide control over the host or server on which a new virtual machine (VM) is placed. By using server placement groups, high availability solutions can be created within a data center. Apply an affinity or anti-affinity policy to each VM instance within a server placement group. After creating e a placement group, provision a new VM instance in the placement group. When setting a placement group with an affinity policy, all VMs in that placement group are launched on the same server. When setting a placement group with an anti-affinity policy, all VMs in that placement group are launched on different servers. Learn more about placement groups . VM pinning policy: VM pinning controls the movement of VMs during disasters and other restart events. Learn more about hard and soft pinning here . SSH key: A SSH public/private key pair is required to to access the instance. Learn more about using and generating SSH keys here . Operating system: PowerVS instances can run either IBM AIX, IBM i, or Linux operating systems (OS). Several Linux images are available specifically for servers that will run SAP. OS image: Users have the ability to choose an operating system image from the PowerVS image catalog or users can bring their own image. Each supported OS has a specific set of images in the PowerVS catalog for supported OS versions. Each instance is provisioned with a 25 gigabyte (GB) boot volume. Storage tier: PowerVS supports both Tier 1 and Tier 3 storage. Tier 1 provides a maximum of 100 input/output operations per second (IOPs) per GB, while Tier 3 provides a maximum of 3 IOPS/GB. Tier 3 storage should only be utilized for non-production workloads. Storage pool affinity: Three storage pool affinity options are available: Auto-select, affinity, and anti-affinity. The affinity option specifies requires the boot volume to be placed in the same pool as another existing instance or existing boot volume. The new storage volume(s) for the instance will be placed in the same storage pool where the affinity object resides. The anti-affinity specifies a different pool should be used from that of another existing instance or existing boot volume. Machine type: Two IBM Power Systems machine types are supported: s922 and e980. Learn more about these s922 here and the e980 here . Core type: PowerVS supports shared uncapped , shared capped , and dedicated cores. Shared uncapped cores are shared among other clients. Shared capped cores are shared, but resources do not expand beyond those that are requested (used mostly for licensing). Dedicated cores are allocated for a specific client (used for specific third-party considerations). Learn more about core types here . Number of cores: The option for the number of cores assigned to an instance depends on the core type. Shared capped and unshared capped cores support .25 core increments, while dedicated cores must be assigned a full core. Note, the maximum number of cores will depend on the machine type and availability in the selected location. Amount of memory: PowerVS instances must be provisioned with a minimum of 2GB of random access memory (RAM). The maximum amount of memory varies based upon machine type and availability in the selected location. If greater than 64GB RAM per core is specified, a higher price is charged. Additional storage volumes: When provisioning a new instance, for additional storage, a new data volume can be created or an existing volume can be attached. Networking: PowerVS instances will always be attached to a private network and can optionally be attached to a public, Internet accessible network. Use private networks to connect to existing subnets or go a new subnet can be created. Learn more about PowerVS networking and network security here .
