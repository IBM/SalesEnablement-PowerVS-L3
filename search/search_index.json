The goal of this demonstration guide is to provide IBM and Business Partner Sales and Technical Sales the knowledge and tools to perform introductory demonstrations of IBM Power Systems Virtual Server (PowerVS). There are 9 parts to this demonstration guide as seen in the left hand navigation. To complete the IBM Power Systems Virtual Server - Level 3 badge requirements, IBM and Business Partner sellers must complete Parts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 9 of this demonstration guide. The IBM and Business Partner technical sellers must complete all sections. The associated Learning Plan Stand and Deliver rubrics (IBM) and quizzes (Business Partners) are based upon the sections required for the respective roles. Sellers are welcome and encouraged to complete all sections. Each of the parts of this guide have detailed steps for demonstrating IBM Power Systems Virtual Server. Click on each part name in the left hand navigation bar to expand the section. In parts 1, 2, and 3, you learn how the demonstration environment was built and how to perform a \"baking show\" style demonstration using the IBM Cloud Portal, click-thru demonstrations, and videos. Note that you will not be provisioning new PowerVS services or virtual machines, rather you will access pre-provisioned resources. Utilizing the pre-provisioned, shared environment will save you time and save IBM money. In Part 4, learn how to use the IBM Cloud Portal to manage PowerVS instances. In Part 5, learn how to access the pre-provisioned PowerVS instances using the IBM Cloud Shell. Parts 1 through 5 provide a good foundation for performing a high-level, customer facing demonstration of IBM Power Systems Virtual Server. Parts 6 through 8 introduce a few more technical aspects of IBM Power Systems Virtual Server including using the PowerVS IBM Cloud command line interface (CLI) plugin. Finally, in Part 9, learn where to find additional resources about IBM Power Systems Virtual Server. Before jumping to part 1, please read the guidance below. Reading and understanding the information will save you time while completing the steps in this guide. Helpful tips for using this demonstration guide and environment The IBM Power Systems Virtual Server - Level 3 Demonstration Guide is organized in parts and sub-parts or chapters. Most chapters contain numbered steps, which are actions that you will perform. Throughout the guide, you will see images that are examples of what you should be seeing in the IBM Cloud Portal, IBM Cloud Shell, and PowerVS instances consoles. In some images, you will see the following styles of highlighting: Action highlight box: Illustrates where you should click, enter, or select an item: Path/explore highlight box: Illustrates one of two things: the path to follow to get to a specific location in the user interface areas to explore on your own Copy to clipboard box: Text that is copied to your clipboard. Click the copy icon (highlighted below) and then paste using your operating systems paste function, for example, entering Ctrl +v , Cmd +v , or right click and select paste. Additionally, there are several \"click-thru\" demonstrations. Links to click-thru demonstrations will open in a new browser window or tab with a screen similar to the image below. Click the play button in the middle of the screen to start the demo. Then, simply follow the steps in the demonstration guide. If at any point you are unsure where to click, click anywhere on the screen and a highlight box will appear showing where to click next. In this demonstration environment, you will NOT have full access to the IBM Cloud account or PowerVS capabilities. Your user ID will be restricted to specific capabilities. You will not have permissions to create or modify PowerVS service instances, virtual machines (instances), networks, images, etc. Warning Attempting to perform an action that you do not have permissions for will result in an error message like the one below. This is not an issue with the IBM Cloud or PowerVS, rather a restriction of the demo environment and the permissions assigned to users.

You should be familiar with PowerVS and should have completed the IBM Power Systems Virtual Server Sales Foundation Badge. This demonstration environment has multiple purposes. First, it is meant to educate you on IBM Power Systems Virtual Server (PowerVS) and to hone your skills to perform PowerVS demonstrations. Additionally, the IBM Technology Zone (TechZone) environment can be re-used to perform actual client demonstrations. Important The focus of the demonstration is on the Infrastructure as a Service capability of PowerVS and not on the operating systems supported by the offering: AIX, IBM i, and Linux.
