These servers are distinct from the IBM Cloud servers with separate networks and direct-attached storage. While the PowerVS internal networks are fenced, they still offer connectivity options to meet customer requirements, including public internet. This carefully calibrated infrastructure enables PowerVS to maintain key software certifications and support like their on-premises infrastructure, but with the added flexibility and capabilities that come from Cloud.</p> <p>The IBM Power Virtual Server workspace allows users to quickly create and deploy one or more virtual server instances (that are running either the AIX, IBM i, or Linux operating systems). After a PowerVS virtual server instance (VSI) is provisioned, users get access to the VSI without the need to manage or operate the physical servers. However, users must manage the operating system, software applications, and data. Given that this course is primarily a demonstration of infrastructure as a service, the guide does not delve deeply into the application layer or the day to day administrative tasks. The guide explores the fundamentals of working with PowerVS VSIs using the IBM Cloud Portal and command-line interfaces (CLIs).</p> <p>It is important to understand the difference in terminology between a PowerVS workspace and a PowerVS instance. Think of the PowerVS workspace as a container for all PowerVS instances at a specific geographic region. A workspace is also similar to a data center. PowerVS instances are virtual machines (VMs). For example, a Cloud account can have multiple PowerVS workspaces: one in Dallas, Texas, and another in Washington, D.C. Each service can contain multiple VSIs (also known as VMs). A workspace must be associated with an IBM Cloud resource group. Resource groups help in grouping resources and assigning permissions. To learn more, refer to Getting Started with IBM Power Virtual Server.</p> <p>The key parameters for a PowerVS workspace are:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Data center location: As of June 2024, PowerVS is colocated with 21 IBM Cloud data centers that are located around the world. Consider choosing the data center that is located nearest to most users that access the PowerVS workloads.</p> </li> <li> <p>Workspace name: The PowerVS workspace name appears in the IBM Cloud Portal under the provisioned workspace. Specify a name that is easily understood and recognized.</p> </li> <li> <p>Resource group: Resource groups are used to organize resources in an IBM Cloud account. Administrative and access rights for all PowerVS resources are associated with the PowerVS workspace and not individual PowerVS instances (VMs). After a PowerVS workspace is assigned to a resource group, the resource group cannot be changed.</p> </li> <li> <p>Integrations: Optional integrations are also available from IBM Cloud. As of June 2024, the only integration available is with IBM Cloud Monitoring. IBM Cloud Monitoring allows users to gain visibility into the resources (VSIs) in the workspace.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"Part%202/02%20Watch-service/","title":"02 Watch service","text":"<p>In this chapter, watch a video of an IBM Power Virtual Server workspace being provisioned in the IBM Cloud Portal.</p> <p>This video includes audio that explains the steps being taken and things to consider while making choices on options.

A VSI is also referred to as a virtual machines (VM) or a logical partition (LPAR). The key parameters for provisioning a PowerVS VSI are:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Instance name: The PowerVS instance name appears in the IBM Cloud Portal under the list of instances within a service. Specify a name that is easily understood and recognized.</p> </li> <li> <p>Server placement group: Server placement groups provide control over the host or server on which a new VM is placed. By using server placement groups, high availability solutions can be created within a data center. Apply an affinity or anti-affinity policy to each VM instance within a server placement group. All VMs in a placement group with an affinity policy are started on the same server. All VMs in a placement group with an anti-affinity policy are started on different servers. Learn more about placement groups.</p> </li> <li> <p>VM pinning policy: VM pinning controls the movement of VMs during disasters and other restart events. Learn more about hard and soft pinning here.</p> </li> <li> <p>SSH key: An SSH public and private key pair is required to access the instance. An SSH key must be created and loaded into the IBM Cloud Portal before an instance can be provisioned. Learn more about using and generating SSH keys here.</p> </li> <li> <p>Operating system: PowerVS instances can run either IBM AIX, IBM i, or Linux operating systems (OS). Several Linux images are available specifically for servers that run SAP.</p> </li> <li> <p>OS image: Users can choose an operating system image from the PowerVS image catalog or users can bring their own image. Each supported OS has a specific set of images in the PowerVS catalog for supported OS versions. Each instance is provisioned with a boot volume that uses the storage tier selected.</p> </li> <li> <p>Storage tier: PowerVS supports 4 tiers of storage. Tier 3 provides a maximum of 3 input/output operations per second (IOPs) per gigabyte (GB). Tier 1 provides a maximum of 10 IOPs/GB. Tier 0 provides a maximum of 25 IOPs/GB. The Fixed IOPs tier provides 5,000 IOPs regardless of size; however, the Fixed IOPs tier is limited to volumes with a size of 200 GB or less.</p> </li> <li> <p>Storage pool affinity: Three storage pool affinity options are available: auto-select, affinity, and anti-affinity. The affinity option requires the boot volume to be placed in the same pool as another existing instance or existing boot volume. New storage volumes for the instance are placed in the same storage pool as the affinity object. The anti-affinity policy specifies a different pool must be used from another existing instance or existing boot volume.</p> </li> <li> <p>Machine type: Several IBM Power9 and IBM Power10 machine types are supported. Availability of machine types vary by data center. Learn more about the hardware specifications available here.</p> </li> <li> <p>Core type: PowerVS supports shared uncapped, shared capped, and dedicated cores. Shared uncapped cores are shared among other clients. Shared capped cores are shared, but resources do not expand beyond what is requested (used mostly for licensing). Dedicated cores are allocated for a specific client (used for specific third-party licensing considerations). Learn more about core types here.</p> </li> <li> <p>Number of cores: The option for the number of cores assigned to an instance depends on the core type. Shared capped and unshared capped cores support 0.25 core increments, while dedicated cores must be assigned a full core. The maximum number of cores depends on the machine type and availability in the selected location.</p> </li> <li> <p>Amount of memory: PowerVS instances must be provisioned with a minimum of 2 GB of random access memory (RAM). The maximum amount of memory varies based on machine type and availability in the selected location. If greater than 64 GB RAM per core is specified, a higher price is charged.</p> </li> <li> <p>Additional storage volumes: A new data volume can be created when an instance is provisioned. The size of a volume cannot be decreased after it is created. The maximum size of a volume that can be created is 238,193 GB. A storage tier can be specified. The volume can also be marked as shareable or nonshareable (default). Additional volumes created when the VM is created, the same storage pool as the boot volume for the VM is used.</p> </li> <li> <p>Networking: PowerVS instances are attached to a private network and can optionally be attached to a public, internet accessible network. Use private networks to connect to existing subnets. A new subnet can be created also. Learn more about PowerVS networking here.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Three click through demonstrations are provided in the next chapters.

PowerVS allows clients to rapidly provision new virtual server instances (VSIs) with AIX, IBM i, or Linux operating systems(OS). Ultimately, clients want to deploy applications on those VSIs. The applications that clients choose to deploy vary widely. They include middleware like databases, third-party software products like SAP, or in-house applications. To install these applications, they need to access the instance and install the software.</p> <p>A fundamental challenge that clients face is how to connect their on-premises data sources with off-premises (cloud-based) resources and services. Doing so securely, efficiently, and cost-effectively is undeniably a challenge for organizations of every size, whether they are a mid-sized business or an enterprise company.</p> <p>Three main methods are:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Public internet</p> </li> <li> <p>Virtual private network (VPN) tunnel</p> </li> <li> <p>IBM Cloud Direct Link (2.0)</p> </li> </ul> <p>Usually, clients deploy PowerVS instances that use a secured network like Direct Link or Virtual Private Network (VPN).</p> <p>IBM Cloud Direct Link (2.0) provides a level of trusted connectivity from enterprise sources to a client's IBM Cloud private network. IBM Cloud Direct Link (2.0) is tailored to every client's workload requirements or business use case.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Direct Link Connect is a solution for data center to data center connectivity (between clouds, or between on-premises and cloud), flexible bandwidth requirements, and multicloud environments. It also presents a less costly entry for IBM Cloud network clients compared to other Direct Link offerings.</p> </li> <li> <p>Direct Link Dedicated is built for clients that have high-volume workloads that require low latency, or for those clients rapidly moving data across multicloud environments. It satisfies stringent compliance requirements that are held by certain countries or industries. Dedicated also supports universal connectivity for either colocation or carrier.</p> </li> <li> <p>Dedicated Hosting options are also available for clients with nonstandard technologies (requiring bespoke networking solutions). Many such clients need to maintain and continue to use their existing IT investments, as they invest in cloud-based technologies. Dedicated storage options are available in parallel for such clients. The connection point for Dedicated Hosting is next to an IBM Cloud data center to provide optimal latency and performance.</p> </li> <li> <p>IBM Cloud VPN access allows users to manage all servers remotely and securely over the IBM Cloud private network. A VPN connection from a remote location to the private network gives the capability for out-of-band management and server rescue through an encrypted VPN tunnel.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Next, learn how to access a running instance by using secure socket shell (SSH) from the IBM Cloud Shell command-line interface, taking a programmatic approach toward managing PowerVS instances.</p>"},{"location":"Part%205/02%20Access-instance/","title":"Access an instance","text":"<p>Accessing an IBM Power Virtual Server (PowerVS) virtual server instance (VSI) depends on several factors, including the operating system the instance is running and the network connectivity available.

The attribute is typically used in highly available (HA) deployments, for instance when PowerHA system mirroring capabilities are used. Learn more about HA and Diaster Recovery (DR) in PowerVS here.</p> <p>f. A storage volume must be assigned to a storage pool. By default, the volume is assigned to any pool that has sufficient capacity. The volume can be controlled by affinity rules. The volume can be assigned to an affinity pool or an anti-affinity pool. Affinity can be based on either other storage volumes or upon virtual server instances (VSIs), also known as virtual machines (VMs). If a storage volume is marked with an affinity policy, it is created in the same pool as other volumes with which it needs to have affinity. An affinity policy is typically used for cloning and snapshots. If a storage volume is marked with an anti-affinity policy, it is created in a different pool from other volumes with which it needs anti-affinity. The anti-affinity policy is typically used for HA and logical mirroring of volumes.</p> <p>g. The affinity and anti-affinity object can be either another storage volume or a VSI.</p> <p>h.

It is designed to provide simplified deployment by users, scalability, and modularity. A deployable architecture incorporates one or more modules. Deployable architectures are coded in Terraform, which you configure with input variables to achieve a wanted behavior. Learn more about deployable architectures here.</p> <p>As of July 2024, IBM Power Virtual Server (PowerVS) has 2 deployable architectures in the IBM Cloud Catalog.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Power Virtual Server with VPC landing zone</p> <p>Provisioning Power Virtual Server with Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) landing zone by using deployable architectures provides an automated deployment method to create an isolated PowerVS workspace and connect it with IBM Cloud services and public internet. Network management components like DNS, NTP, proxy servers, and NFS as a Service might be installed. Comparing the provisioning through the projects UI, user interaction is minimized and ready-to-go deployment time of a PowerVS workspace is reduced from days to less than 1 hour. Learn more about this deployable architecture here.</p> </li> <li> <p>Power Virtual Server for SAP HANA</p> <p>SAP solution provisioning on PowerVS using deployable architectures provides an automated deployment method to create a PowerVS landscape with SAP HANA systems. User interaction is minimized and SAP system deployment time is reduced from weeks to days. This deployable architecture is a composition or stack of this deployable architecture and the Power Virtual Server with VPC. Learn more about this deployable architecture here.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The click through demonstration that follows steps through the provisioning of the Power Virtual Server with VPC landing zone deployable architecture. A brief tour of the environment is also provided in the click through demonstration. The deployed solution is available in the IBM Technology Zone environment that is associated with this demonstration guide. You have view-only access to the PowerVS workspace and the associated virtual private cloud (VPC). </p> <p>Several prerequisite steps were completed before provisioning the deployable architecture. These include creating an IBM Cloud application programming key (API) and an IBM Cloud Secrets Manager instance. The API key was also added to the secrets manager instance. In addition, an SSH public and private key pair was created to enable access to the VSI create by the deployable architecture.</p> <p>Use the click through demonstration to experience provisioning a deployable architecture for PowerVS.</p> <p>Note, fields that require a text entry (for example workspace name) are pre-populated in the click through demonstration.</p> <p>Tip</p> <p>Not sure where to click or what to do next?

They enable teams to configure, deploy, and monitor deployments by using DevOps best practices. Each project includes tools to scan for potentially harmful resource changes, compliance, security, and cost, tracking configuration versioning, and governance. They are designed with an IaC and a compliance-first approach that helps to ensure that a project is managed, secure, and always compliant.
