These servers are distinct from the IBM Cloud servers with separate networks and direct-attached storage. While the PowerVS internal networks are fenced, they still offer connectivity options to meet customer requirements, including public internet. This carefully calibrated infrastructure enables PowerVS to maintain key software certifications and support like their on-premises infrastructure, but with the added flexibility and capabilities that come from Cloud.</p> <p>The IBM Power Virtual Server workspace allows users to quickly create and deploy one or more virtual server instances (that are running either the AIX, IBM i, or Linux operating systems). After a PowerVS virtual server instance (VSI) is provisioned, users get access to the VSI without the need to manage or operate the physical servers. However, users must manage the operating system, software applications, and data. Given that this course is primarily a demonstration of infrastructure as a service, the guide does not delve deeply into the application layer or the day to day administrative tasks. The guide explores the fundamentals of working with PowerVS VSIs using the IBM Cloud Portal and command-line interfaces (CLIs).</p> <p>It is important to understand the difference in terminology between a PowerVS workspace and a PowerVS instance. Think of the PowerVS workspace as a container for all PowerVS instances at a specific geographic region. A workspace is also similar to a data center. PowerVS instances are virtual machines (VMs). For example, a Cloud account can have multiple PowerVS workspaces: one in Dallas, Texas, and another in Washington, D.C. Each service can contain multiple VSIs (also known as VMs). A workspace must be associated with an IBM Cloud resource group. Resource groups help in grouping resources and assigning permissions. To learn more, refer to Getting Started with IBM Power Virtual Server.</p> <p>The key parameters for a PowerVS workspace are:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Data center location type and location: Data center location type can be either IBM data center (for PowerVS in IBM Cloud case) or Client location (for PowerVS private cloud case). For the sake of this demonstration, location type IBM data center applies. As of April 2025, PowerVS is colocated with 22 IBM Cloud data centers that are located around the world. Consider choosing the data center location that is located nearest to most users that access the PowerVS workloads.</p> </li> <li> <p>Workspace name: The PowerVS workspace name appears in the IBM Cloud Portal under the provisioned workspace. Specify a name that is easily understood and recognized.</p> </li> <li> <p>Resource group: Resource groups are used to organize resources in an IBM Cloud account. Administrative and access rights for all PowerVS resources are associated with the PowerVS workspace and not individual PowerVS instances (VMs). After a PowerVS workspace is assigned to a resource group, the resource group cannot be changed.Tags can also be specified in the resource group section. Tags are  custom labels that aid in organization, identification, and management. There are 2 types of tags:</p> <ul> <li>User tags: User tags are added to resources or service IDs by an authorized user in the account. Add user tags to your resources to organize, track, and manage costs for related resources. For example, <code>env:dev</code>, <code>env:test</code> tags can be used to identify different development environments.</li> <li>Access management tags: Access management tags are used to manage access to resources. They can be created in advance for use in access policies, which grant access to the resources where access management tags are attached. For example, <code>project: lw-wizard</code>, <code>app: poc-app</code> tags can be used to manage access to different projects.</li> <li>For more information on tags, refer to this document.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Integrations: When creating a Power Virtual Server workspace, several optional integration options are available to enhance connectivity and functionality. In this demonstration we will leverage the integration of PowerVS with IBM Cloud Monitoring. IBM Cloud Monitoring allows users to gain visibility into the resources (VSIs) in the PowerVS workspace.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"Part%202/02%20Watch-service/","title":"02 Watch service","text":"<p>In this chapter, watch a video of an IBM Power Virtual Server workspace being provisioned in the IBM Cloud Portal.</p> <p>This video includes audio that explains the steps being taken and things to consider while making choices on options.

A VSI is also referred to as a virtual machines (VM) or a logical partition (LPAR). The key parameters for provisioning a PowerVS VSI are:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Instance name: The PowerVS instance name appears in the IBM Cloud Portal under the list of instances within a service. Specify a name that is easily understood and recognized.</p> </li> <li> <p>User tags (optional): Tags are custom labels that aid in organization, identification, and management. User tags are added to resources or service IDs by an authorized user in the account. Add user tags to your resources to organize, track, and manage costs for related resources. For example, <code>env:dev</code>, <code>env:test</code> tags can be used to identify different development environments. For more information on tags, refer to this document.</p> </li> <li> <p>Server placement group: Server placement groups provide control over the host or server on which a new VM is placed. By using server placement groups, high availability solutions can be created within a data center. Apply an affinity or anti-affinity policy to each VM instance within a server placement group. All VMs in a placement group with an affinity policy are started on the same server. All VMs in a placement group with an anti-affinity policy are started on different servers. Learn more about placement groups.</p> </li> <li> <p>Shared processor pool: Shared processor pools (SPP) can be used to split cores between a set of VSIs and provides a better overall ability to manage processor resources. SPP helps reduce software licensing costs by limiting the number of processors an uncapped partition can use. For more information on SPP, refer to this document.</p> </li> <li> <p>Virtual server pinning: Virtual server pinning controls the movement of VMs during disasters and other restart events. Learn more about hard and soft pinning here.</p> </li> <li> <p>SSH key: An SSH public and private key pair is required to access the instance. An SSH key must be created and loaded into the IBM Cloud Portal before an instance can be provisioned. Learn more about using and generating SSH keys here.</p> </li> <li> <p>Operating system: IBM Power Virtual Server supports Linux, IBM i, and IBM AIX operating systems (OS). Under linux, both RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and Suse Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) distributions are supported. With the support of these operating systems you can deploy several applications, including SAP HANA, SAP S/4HANA, and SAP NetWeaver. Clients can also run Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform to accelerate their application modernization efforts by using new cloud-native applications.IBM provides stock AIX, Linux and IBM i images when creating a Power Virtual Server. However, clients can always bring their own custom AIX, IBM i, or Linux image that is tested and deployed. For more information on supported OSes and Bring your own image options, refer to the below:</p> <ul> <li>For PowerVS in IBM data center, refer to this document.</li> <li>For PowerVS in client location (PowerVS private cloud), refer to this document.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>OS image: Users can choose an operating system image from the PowerVS image catalog or users can bring their own image. Each supported OS has a specific set of images in the PowerVS catalog for supported OS versions. Each instance is provisioned with a boot volume that uses the storage tier selected.</p> </li> <li> <p>Configure for Epic workloads (Applicable for AIX OS only): Clients can configure virtual machine (VM) instance to deploy Epic workloads when they select AIX as their operating system. For more information on configuring a VM for Epic workloads, refer to this document.</p> <p>What are Epic systems?</p> <p>Epic Systems, also known simply as Epic, is one of the largest providers of health information technology, used primarily by large U.S. hospitals and health systems to access, organize, store and share electronic medical records. Epic remains one of the largest electronic health record (EHR) vendors in the United States. </p> </li> <li> <p>Deploy empty virtual server instance: Clients can create or provision a virtual server instance (VM) without any initial boot image volume. VMs without boot volume are helpful in high availability and disaster recovery use cases. A VM can be created without a boot volume and the volume that is cloned or replicated can be attached to a VM to bring the backed-up VM. For more information, refer to this document.</p> </li> <li> <p>Virtual serial number (VSN) (Applicable for IBM i OS only): A VSN keeps track of installation, support entitlements, and licensing compliance for IBM i software. For more information, refer to this document.</p> </li> <li> <p>IBM i Licenses (Applicable for IBM i OS only): When IBM i OS is selected, the IBM Power Virtual Server offering encompasses not only the IBM i OS but also additional Licensed Program Products (LPP) and various IBM i operating system features. For a complete list of included LPPs and OS features, refer to this document. Additional LPPs for IBM i are available for purchase and can be included in VM instances. To incorporate one or more of these LPPs, select the desired licenses for inclusion in the VM instance. As of Apr. 2025, the following licenses can be purchased through the Power Virtual Server offering: IBM i Cloud Storage Solutions (5773-ICC), IBM i Power HA (5770-HAS), and Rational Development Studio for IBM i (5770-WDS).</p> </li> <li> <p>Storage tier: PowerVS supports 4 tiers of storage. Tier 3 provides a maximum of 3 input/output operations per second (IOPs) per gigabyte (GB). Tier 1 provides a maximum of 10 IOPs/GB. Tier 0 provides a maximum of 25 IOPs/GB. The Fixed IOPs tier provides 5,000 IOPs regardless of size; however, the Fixed IOPs tier is limited to volumes with a size of 200 GB or less. For more information, refer to this document.</p> </li> <li> <p>Storage pool affinity: Three storage pool affinity options are available: auto-select, affinity, and anti-affinity. The affinity option requires the boot volume to be placed in the same pool as another existing instance or existing boot volume. New storage volumes for the instance are placed in the same storage pool as the affinity object. The anti-affinity policy specifies a different pool must be used from existing instance or existing boot volume. For more information, refer to this document.</p> </li> <li> <p>Cloud-init user data: Cloud-init user data is utilized during the boot process of a virtual machine (VM) to automate initial configurations. This includes setting up user accounts, SSH keys, installing packages, configuring network settings, and other system settings. Essentially, it allows for the customization of the VM environment without manual intervention, ensuring that the VM is ready for use immediately after boot. Power Virtual Server user interface provides an option to pass in user data or scripts during the first boot runtime. To finalize the user data for Linux images, validation checks must be completed as required. Validation checks are not performed for AIX and Bring Your Own License (BYOL) images.</p> </li> <li> <p>Boot volume replication: Boot volume replication in IBM Power Virtual Server involves creating replicated volumes to ensure data availability and disaster recovery. This process uses Global Replication Services (GRS), which provides asynchronous volume-level replication. For more information, refer to this document.</p> </li> <li> <p>Deploy to dedicated host: Using the dedicated host capability on IBM Power\u00ae Virtual Server, clients can provision an entire server for their sole use, significantly expanding their computing options. Clients can handle mission-critical workloads with complete isolation, control, and security. For more information, refer to this document.</p> </li> <li> <p>Machine type: As of April 2025, IBM Power9 and IBM Power10 machine types are supported. Availability of machine types vary by data center. Learn more about the hardware specifications available here.</p> </li> <li> <p>Core type: PowerVS supports shared uncapped, shared capped, and dedicated cores. Shared uncapped cores are shared among other clients. Shared capped cores are shared, but resources do not expand beyond what is requested (used mostly for licensing). Dedicated cores are allocated for a specific client (used for specific third-party licensing considerations). Learn more about core types here.</p> </li> <li> <p>Number of cores: The option for the number of cores assigned to an instance depends on the core type. Shared capped and unshared capped cores support 0.25 core increments, while dedicated cores must be assigned a full core. The maximum number of cores depends on the machine type and availability in the selected location.</p> </li> <li> <p>Virtual cores: Virtual cores in IBM Power Virtual Server refer to units of virtual processor resources allocated to a partition or virtual machine. These virtual cores can be mapped to physical processor cores or time-sliced across them, allowing for flexible resource management. For more information on virtual cores concept and how it works in the context of shared processor pools, refer to this document. For more information on how to manage core to virtual core ratio, refer to this document.</p> </li> <li> <p>Amount of memory: PowerVS instances must be provisioned with a minimum of 2 GB of random access memory (RAM). The maximum amount of memory varies based on machine type and availability in the selected location. If greater than 64 GB RAM per core is specified, a higher price is charged.</p> </li> <li> <p>Additional storage volumes: Storage volumes in IBM Power Virtual Server are virtual storage devices that can be attached to virtual machines (VMs) to provide persistent storage. Clients can either create a new data volume or attach an existing one that they defined in their account. A new data volume can be created when an instance is provisioned. The size of a volume cannot be decreased after it is created. The maximum size of a volume that can be created is 238,193 GB. A storage tier can be specified. The volume can also be marked as shareable or nonshareable (default). Volume replication (using GRS) for data volumes can be enabled (default is off). Additional volumes created when the VM is created, use the same storage pool as the boot volume for the VM uses. For more information on creating data volumes, refer to the section \"Table 4. Provisioning a VM with or without a boot volume.\" in this link.</p> </li> <li> <p>Configure for large quantity volumes: Enable the Configure for large quantity volumes toggle button to support more than 127 (up to 500) volumes. This setting is at a VM-level that remains unmodifiable upon provisioning. For more information, refer to this document.</p> </li> <li> <p>Networking: PowerVS instances are attached to a private network and can optionally be attached to a public, internet accessible network. Use private networks to connect to existing subnets. A new subnet can be created also. Learn more about PowerVS networking here.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Three click through demonstrations are provided in the next chapters. One for each of the supported operating systems: AIX, Linux, and IBM i. While each is similar, a few minor differences exist.

PowerVS allows clients to rapidly provision new virtual server instances (VSIs) with AIX, IBM i, or Linux operating systems(OS). Ultimately, clients want to deploy applications on those VSIs. The applications that clients choose to deploy vary widely. They include middleware like databases, third-party software products like SAP, or in-house applications. To install these applications, they need to access the instance and install the software.</p> <p>A fundamental challenge that clients face is how to connect their on-premises data sources with off-premises (cloud-based) resources and services. Doing so securely, efficiently, and cost-effectively is undeniably a challenge for organizations of every size, whether they are a mid-sized business or an enterprise company.</p> <p>Three main methods are:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Public internet</p> </li> <li> <p>Virtual private network (VPN) tunnel</p> </li> <li> <p>IBM Cloud Direct Link (2.0)</p> </li> </ul> <p>Usually, clients deploy PowerVS instances that use a secured network like Direct Link or Virtual Private Network (VPN).</p> <p>IBM Cloud Direct Link (2.0) provides a level of trusted connectivity from enterprise sources to a client's IBM Cloud private network. IBM Cloud Direct Link (2.0) is tailored to every client's workload requirements or business use case.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Direct Link Connect is a solution for data center to data center connectivity (between clouds, or between on-premises and cloud), flexible bandwidth requirements, and multicloud environments. It also presents a less costly entry for IBM Cloud network clients compared to other Direct Link offerings.</p> </li> <li> <p>Direct Link Dedicated is built for clients that have high-volume workloads that require low latency, or for those clients rapidly moving data across multicloud environments. It satisfies stringent compliance requirements that are held by certain countries or industries. Dedicated also supports universal connectivity for either colocation or carrier.</p> </li> <li> <p>Dedicated Hosting options are also available for clients with nonstandard technologies (requiring bespoke networking solutions). Many such clients need to maintain and continue to use their existing IT investments, as they invest in cloud-based technologies. Dedicated storage options are available in parallel for such clients. The connection point for Dedicated Hosting is next to an IBM Cloud data center to provide optimal latency and performance.</p> </li> <li> <p>IBM Cloud VPN access allows users to manage all servers remotely and securely over the IBM Cloud private network. A VPN connection from a remote location to the private network gives the capability for out-of-band management and server rescue through an encrypted VPN tunnel.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"Part%205/02%20Access-instance/","title":"Access an instance","text":"<p>Accessing an IBM Power Virtual Server (PowerVS) virtual server instance (VSI) depends on several factors, including the operating system the instance is running and the network connectivity available. Remote login tools like Secure Socket Shell (SSH), telnet, and other console emulators can be used to access instances. PowerVS also provides access to running instances by using a web-based console tool. Usually, clients deploy PowerVS instances that use a secured network like Direct Link or Virtual Private Network (VPN).

If a storage volume is marked with an affinity policy, it is created in the same pool as other volumes with which it needs to have affinity. An affinity policy is typically used for cloning and snapshots. If a storage volume is marked with an anti-affinity policy, it is created in a different pool from other volumes with which it needs anti-affinity. The anti-affinity policy is typically used for HA and logical mirroring of volumes.</p> </li> <li> <p>The affinity and anti-affinity object can be either another storage volume or a VSI.

IBM Cloud Shell gives users complete control of their cloud resources, applications, and infrastructure, from any web browser. IBM Cloud Shell provides pre-authenticated access to tools and programming languages for cloud-based development, deployment, and management of services and applications. IBM Cloud Shell is instantly accessible from the IBM Cloud portal. The IBM command-line interface (CLI) along with all the IBM Cloud CLI plug-ins are preinstalled in IBM Cloud Shell, including the PowerVS CLIs.</p> <p>It is also possible to install the IBM Cloud CLIs and PowerVS CLI plug-in on other systems, like personal desktop and development servers. Learn more about installing the PowerVS CLI locally here.</p> <p>To get started, first open the IBM Cloud Shell from the IBM Cloud portal:</p> <ol> <li>Open the IBM Cloud Portal: https://cloud.ibm.com/ and authenticate with your IBM Cloud credentials.</li> <li> <p>Change to the 2305900 - ITZ - ADHOC03 account.</p> <p></p> <p>Tip</p> <p>If the browser window is narrow, this icon:  is seen instead of the current account name as shown in the preceding screen capture.</p> </li> <li> <p>Click the IBM Cloud Shell icon .</p> <p></p> </li> </ol> <p>The next steps are run in the IBM Cloud Shell window that was opened.</p> <p>To avoid typographical errors copy the command line by using the  icon when it is available. Then paste the contents into the IBM Cloud Shell using keyboard shortcuts (operating system specific, for example, Ctrl-V for Windows OS), or right click in the IBM Cloud Shell and select Paste or \"Paste as plain text\" option.    </p> <ol> <li> <p>To display a concise list of all command-line options for the PowerVS plug-in, use the <code>pi</code> argument, which stands for power-iaas. This command provides a summary of available options and their functionalities. Note that <code>pi</code> is also referred to as a plug-in for the <code>ibmcloud</code> command.</p> <pre><code>ibmcloud pi --help | more\n</code></pre> Tip for novice Linux users! <p>If you are not familiar with Linux commands, don't worry. The preceding command is two commands. The first is <code>ibmcloud pi --help</code>. This command runs the help option of the PowerVS plug-in. The second command is <code>more</code>. This command pauses the output being displayed. The \"|\" or pipe character takes the output from the first command and sends it as input to the second command. Search the internet for Linux primer to learn more about Linux commands.</p> </li> <li> <p>Press the space bar to continue the output. Continue to press space bar several times to scroll through the complete output.</p> <p>Notice the last part of the message: Use \"pi [command] --help\" for more information about a command. Use this to get more help on individual PowerVS plug-in commands.</p> </li> <li> <p>For example, to list detailed help on PowerVS images, use the <code>image</code> plug-in command.</p> <pre><code>ibmcloud pi image --help\n</code></pre> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>List all the PowerVS workspaces provisioned in the account.</p> <pre><code>ibmcloud pi workspace ls\n</code></pre> <p>Sample output</p> <p></p> <p>To view the PowerVS virtual server instances (VSI) in the workspace, the workspace target must first be set for the PowerVS plug-in.</p> </li> <li> <p>Set the workspace target by using the instance ID of the workspace.</p> <pre><code>workspaceID=`ibmcloud pi workspace ls 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep PowerVS-L3-2025 | awk '{print $NF}'`\n</code></pre> Tip for novice Linux users! <p>The command above did 3 actions...</p> <ul> <li>ibmcloud pi workspace ls 2&gt;&amp;1: Lists all workspaces in IBM Cloud PowerVS and redirects both standard output and standard error to standard output.</li> <li>grep PowerVS-L3-2025: Filters the output to include only lines containing the string PowerVS-L3-2025.</li> <li>awk '{print $NF}': Uses awk to print the last field of the filtered line.</li> </ul> <p>Finally, the output was stored in an environment variable called workspaceID.

Because no one wants to type <code>crn:v1:bluemix:public:power-iaas:wdc07:a/ba0e33c9056f470ca19de009747ec654:3e5453c4-6adb-46be-b25d-417adcec9dbb::</code> to run the next command.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use the $workspaceID environment variable to set the target of future PowerVS plug-in commands to the <code>PowerVS-L3-2025</code> workspace (workspace used in this demonstration).</p> <pre><code>ibmcloud pi workspace target $workspaceID\n</code></pre> <p>Sample output</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>List all the PowerVS instances provisioned in the targeted PowerVS workspace.</p> <pre><code>ibmcloud pi instance list\n</code></pre> <p>Sample output</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>View the details of the AIX-VM instance.</p> <pre><code>ibmcloud pi instance get AIX-VM\n</code></pre> <p>Sample output</p> <p></p> </li> </ol> <p>Thus far, all of these commands are read commands. The PowerVS CLIs also support create and update commands, but remember user IDs have access restrictions in this shared environment. Try the instance update command and see what happens.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Recall that the Power environment consists of three PowerVM instances: AIX-VM, Linux-VM, and IBMi-VM. Up until now, commands were issued against AIX-VM. Given that the testing environment is primarily limited to read-only actions, try inspect one of the other VMs and determine what (if any) differences exist between the various instances.</p> <p>Issue the following command to the IBM Cloud Shell: </p><pre><code>ibmcloud pi instance get Linux-VM\n</code></pre> <p>And then issue a second command: </p><pre><code>ibmcloud pi instance get IBMi-VM\n</code></pre> <p>Notice that the two tables are nearly identical, but differences do exist due to the operating systems used on each VSI.</p> </li> <li> <p>There are numerous reasons why one might want to generate an SSH private key for managing a PowerVS environment. In fact, that's exactly what the service's administrators did to authorize your access to the PowerVS instances. Recall when first connecting to the PowerVS virtual machines remotely through the IBM Cloud Shell using the Secure Socket Shell (SSH) command with the supplied key information, in Part 5 - Accessing PowerVS instances section.</p> <p>The IBM Cloud Shell can generate an SSH key that can be used to configure password-less authentication (in other words, allowing users to authenticate without needing to also supply a password). Using IBM Cloud Shell, or any Linux environment, run the following ssh-keygen command:</p> <pre><code>ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N '' -f newKey\n</code></pre> Tip for novice Linux users! <p>The above command performs the following 4 actions...</p> <ul> <li>ssh-keygen: Invokes the SSH key generation tool.</li> <li>-t ed25519: Specifies the type of key to generate, in this case, an Ed25519 key, which is known for its high security and performance.</li> <li>-N '': Sets an empty passphrase for the key, meaning no passphrase is required to use the key.</li> <li>-f newKey: Specifies the filename for the generated key, which will be newKey for the private key and newKey.pub for the public key.</li> </ul> <p>In summary, this command generates a new Ed25519 SSH key pair without a passphrase and saves the keys to files named newKey and newKey.pub. newKey is the private key and newKey.pub is the public key.</p> <p>After the SSH key pair is generated, it can be listed using the following command:</p> <pre><code>ls -l\n</code></pre> <p>Sample output</p> <p></p> <p>Next, use the PowerVS CLIs to create a key for the VSI by using an imported RSA public key. Specify the key pair that was generated as the source (newKey). Do so by using the following command. (Note: newKeyPOWER is the name of the CLI-generated key that is to be created; newKey is the SSH key generated earlier by using the IBM Cloud Shell).</p> <pre><code>ibmcloud pi ssh-key create newKeyPOWER --key newKey\n</code></pre> <p>SSH keys</p> <p>The SSH key-pair generated and assigned by this step is specific to IBM Power Systems. These are distinct from ones generated previously by using the IBM Cloud Shell.</p> <p>Sample output</p> <p></p> <p>As expected, the instruction fails to run because of insufficient (locked down) permissions within this demonstration environment. Next, experiment with other IBM Power CLIs. </p> </li> <li> <p>For example, restart the Linux-VM instance, and see what happens.</p> <pre><code>ibmcloud pi instance action -o soft-reboot Linux-VM\n</code></pre> <p>Sample output</p> <p></p> </li> </ol> <p>There are over 100 PowerVS CLIs. Explore more CLIs by using the ITZ environment.
