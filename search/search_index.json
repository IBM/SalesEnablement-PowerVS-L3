IBM Power Systems Virtual Server (PowerVS) delivers flexible compute capacity for Power Systems workloads. Integrated with the IBM Cloud platform for on-demand provisioning, this offering provides a secure and scalable server virtualization environment built upon the advanced RAS features and leading performance of the Power Systems platform. You should be familiar with PowerVS and should have completed the IBM Power Systems Virtual Server Sales Foundation Badge (Level 2) before embarking on the Level 3 content. The content here is not a replacement for the Level 1 and 2 content that is part of the previous learning plans, which are linked in the documentation accompanying this course. IBM: https://yourlearning.ibm.com/activity/PLAN-4E64FE2FDBF0 Business Partners: https://learn.ibm.com/course/view.php?id=11419 This demonstration environment has multiple purposes. First, it is meant to educate you on IBM Power Systems Virtual Server (PowerVS) and to hone your skills to perform PowerVS demonstrations. Additionally, the IBM Technology Zone (TechZone) environment, this demonstration guide and associated click-thru demos and videos can be re-used to perform client demonstrations. Primarily, our goal is to focus on the Infrastructure as a Service capability of PowerVS and not on the operating systems supported by the offering: AIX, IBM i, and Linux. Throughout the course, you will: In Parts 1, 2, and 3 , learn how the demonstration environment was built, and how to perform a \"baking show\" style demonstration using the IBM Cloud Portal, click-thru demonstrations, and videos. New PowerVS resources are not provisioned as part of this demonstration guide. All resources are pre-provisioned in a shared environment to save time and money. In Part 4 , learn how to use the IBM Cloud Portal to manage PowerVS instances. In Part 5 , learn how to access the pre-provisioned PowerVS instances using IBM Cloud Shell. Parts 1 through 5 provide a good foundation for performing a high-level, customer facing demonstration of IBM Power Systems Virtual Server. Parts 6 and 7 introduce several more technical aspects of IBM Power Systems Virtual Server including using the PowerVS IBM Cloud command line interface (CLI) plugin. Finally, in Part 8 , learn where to find additional resources about IBM Power Systems Virtual Server, and how to complete the IBM Power Systems Virtual Server - Level 3 badge. Remember to reserve your demonstration environment The following instructions will help you get started. You should reserve your environment ahead of time so that the instance has time to provision before you reach the hands-on sections of the lab material. If you have not already done so, go to the IBM Technology Zone collection for PowerVS L3 and click the tab (at the top of the page) labeled \"Complete Learning Activity for IBM Power Systems Virtual Server Level 3 Sales Enablement,\" as shown in the following screenshot. Click the Demonstration Environment tile that has the blue Reserve icon to create a request for a PowerVS instance. Select the Reserve Now option. Rename the instance to something unique to you. For example, 'Bienko-PowerVS-L3'. Set the value of Purpose to Practice / Self-Education . Write a brief note into the Purpose Description field explaining what the environment is to be used for. Under the Preferred Geography field, select Dallas 13 (or another location closer to you, if available). Specify the End Date and Time when your reservation will expire. You can reserve the environment for up to 72 hours. When satisfied, scroll down to the bottom of the page and click Submit to initiate the environment provisioning request. You will now need to wait for IBM Technology Zone to finish provisioning your PowerVS environment \u2014 this process takes approximately 5 to 10 minutes. When ready, you will receive an email to your IBM address and the Reservations page will show a PowerVS tile with the status of Ready . If marked as ready, click anywhere on the tile to drill down into details on how to access your cluster. Important If you click the PowerVS tile before it is marked as Ready (for example, if it shows as \"scheduled\" or \"provisioning\") the details needed to connect to the cluster will either be unavailable or incomplete. You must wait until the environment is Ready before continuing to the next step. After drilling down into the readied PowerVS tile, look towards the bottom of the page for a blue icon labelled as Download SSH Private Key , which contains the SSH key pair you will need to connect to the PowerVS environment over the IBM Cloud Shell. Click the blue icon and download the SSH key to your local downloads folder. Just above the blue icon is a field labelled as User ID \u2014 record that value, as it will be needed later. It should look something like your email address (but with a period . instead of an @ sign). Log in to your email inbox and look for an email from IBM Cloud with the title Account: You are invited to join an account in IBM Cloud . Within the content of the email is a link to Join Now . Click the link and then Accept the invitation on the IBM Cloud portal. This will add the PowerVS instance to your IBM Cloud account.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Part%202/01%20Introduction/","text":"Ways to Watch In addition to the embedded video, IBMers and Business Partners can also download the recording from Seismic . By the time you've enrolled in this Level 3 course, you'll already know that Power Systems Virtual Servers are located across IBM data centers, distinct from the IBM Cloud servers with separate networks and direct-attached storage. These environments operate in their own pod and the internal networks are fenced; however, they still offer connectivity options to meet customer requirements, including public internet. This carefully calibrated infrastructure enables Power Systems Virtual Server to maintain key enterprise software certification and support that customers would receive with on-premises infrastructure, but with the added flexibility and capabilities that come from an IBM Cloud deployment. With the environment provided to your for this Level 3 course via the IBM Technology Zone, we'll explore in detail how to go about configuring your infrastructure to work with private and public endpoints. With the Power Systems Virtual Server service, you can quickly create and deploy one or more virtual servers (that are running either the AIX, IBM i, or Linux operating systems). After you provision the Power Systems Virtual Server, you get access to infrastructure and physical computing resources without the need to manage or operate them. However, you must manage the operating system and the software applications and data. Given that this course is primarily a demonstration of infrastructure as a service, we won't delve too deeply into the application layer or the day to day administrative tasks atop of an IBM i deployment. But we will explore fundamentals of working with AIX and Linux atop of IBM Power Systems Virtual Server, so that you have the expertise necessary to tailor bespoke demonstrations with your clients. Before you create a PowerVS virtual server, you must understand the difference in terminology between a PowerVS service and a PowerVS instance . Think of the PowerVS service as a container for all PowerVS instances at a specific geographic region. PowerVS instances are virtual machines (VMs). The service is available from the Resource List in the IBM Cloud Portal. For example, you can have multiple services: one in Dallas, Texas, and another in Washington, D.C. Each service can contain multiple instances. A service must be associated with an IBM Cloud resource group which helps in grouping resources and assigning permissions. To learn more, refer to Getting Started with IBM Power Systems Virtual Server . The key parameters for a PowerVS service are: Datacenter location : As of August 2022, PowerVS is co-located with 15 IBM Cloud datacenters located around the world. When selecting a datacenter, consider choosing the datacenter located nearest the majority of the end users that will be accessing the workloads running in PowerVS. Service name : The PowerVS service name will appear in the IBM Cloud Portal under the provisioned services. Specify a name that is easily understood and recognized. Resource group : Resource groups are used to organize resources in your IBM Cloud account. Administrative and access rights for all PowerVS resources are associated with the PowerVS service and not individual PowerVS instances (VMs). Once a PowerVS service is assigned to a resource group, the resource group can not be changed. In the chapter to follow, you will view a video of a PowerVS server being provisioned and replicate the steps taken yourself using a click-through guided demonstration.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Part%202/02%20Watch-service/","text":"In this chapter, watch a video of an IBM Power Systems Virtual Server service being provisioned in the IBM Cloud Portal.

IBM Systems Virtual Servers are located in the IBM data centers, distinct from the IBM Cloud servers with separate networks and direct-attached storage. The environment is in its own pod and the internal networks are fenced but offer connectivity options to meet customer requirements. This infrastructure design enables IBM Power Systems Virtual Server to maintain key enterprise software certification and support as the PowerVS architecture is identical to certified on-premises infrastructure. The virtual servers, also known as instances, logical partitions (LPAR), or virtual machines (VMs) run on IBM Power Systems hardware with the PowerVM hypervisor. The key parameters for a PowerVS instance are: Instance name : The PowerVS instance name will appear in the IBM Cloud Portal under the list of instances within a service. Specify a name that is easily understood and recognized. Server placement group : Server placement groups provide control over the host or server on which a new virtual machine (VM) is placed. By using server placement groups, high availability solutions can be created within a data center. Apply an affinity or anti-affinity policy to each VM instance within a server placement group. After creating a placement group, provision a new VM instance in the placement group. When setting a placement group with an affinity policy, all VMs in that placement group are launched on the same server. When setting a placement group with an anti-affinity policy, all VMs in that placement group are launched on different servers. Learn more about placement groups . VM pinning policy : VM pinning controls the movement of VMs during disasters and other restart events. Learn more about hard and soft pinning here . SSH key : An SSH public/private key pair is required to access the instance. An SSH key must be created and loaded into the IBM Cloud Portal prior to creating an instance. Learn more about using and generating SSH keys here . Operating system : PowerVS instances can run either IBM AIX, IBM i, or Linux operating systems (OS). Several Linux images are available specifically for servers that will run SAP. OS image : Users have the ability to choose an operating system image from the PowerVS image catalog or users can bring their own image. Each supported OS has a specific set of images in the PowerVS catalog for supported OS versions. Each instance is provisioned with a boot volume using the storage tier selected. Storage tier : PowerVS supports both Tier 1 and Tier 3 storage. Tier 1 provides a maximum of 100 input/output operations per second (IOPs) per GB, while Tier 3 provides a maximum of 3 IOPS/GB. Tier 3 storage should only be utilized for non-production workloads. Storage pool affinity : Three storage pool affinity options are available: auto-select, affinity, and anti-affinity. The affinity option specifies requires the boot volume to be placed in the same pool as another existing instance or existing boot volume. The new storage volume(s) for the instance will be placed in the same storage pool where the affinity object resides. The anti-affinity specifies a different pool should be used from that of another existing instance or existing boot volume. Machine type : Two IBM Power Systems machine types are supported: s922 and e980. Learn more about these s922 here and the e980 here . Core type : PowerVS supports shared uncapped, shared capped, and dedicated cores. Shared uncapped cores are shared among other clients. Shared capped cores are shared, but resources do not expand beyond those that are requested (used mostly for licensing). Dedicated cores are allocated for a specific client (used for specific third-party licensing considerations). Learn more about core types here . Number of cores : The option for the number of cores assigned to an instance depends on the core type. Shared capped and unshared capped cores support 0.25 core increments, while dedicated cores must be assigned a full core. Note, the maximum number of cores will depend on the machine type and availability in the selected location. Amount of memory : PowerVS instances must be provisioned with a minimum of 2GB of random access memory (RAM). The maximum amount of memory varies based upon machine type and availability in the selected location. If greater than 64GB RAM per core is specified, a higher price is charged. Additional storage volumes : When provisioning a new instance, for additional storage, a new data volume can be created or an existing volume can be attached. Any storage volume added at this time will use the same storage tier as the boot volume specified earlier. Networking : PowerVS instances will always be attached to a private network and can optionally be attached to a public, Internet accessible network. Use private networks to connect to existing subnets or go a new subnet can be created. You can learn more about PowerVS networking here .

IBM Power Systems Virtual Server is an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offering. PowerVS allows clients to rapidly provision new instances running AIX, IBM i, or Linux. Ultimately, clients will want to deploy applications on those machines. The applications that clients choose to deploy will vary widely. They may include middleware like databases, third party software products like SAP, or applications they have developed themselves. To install these applications, they need to access the instance and install the software. A fundamental challenge that every customer examining an expansion to cloud will face is how to connect their on-premises data sources with off-premises (cloud-based) resources and services. Doing so securely, efficiently, and cost- effectively is undeniably a challenge for organizations of every size, whether they are a mid-sized business or an enterprise company. How do you connect to the IBM Cloud? There are 3 routes to take: Via the public internet Via a VPN tunnel Via IBM Cloud Direct Link (2.0) In most cases, clients will deploy PowerVS instances using a secured network like Direct Link or Virtual Private Network (VPN). IBM Cloud Direct Link (2.0) provides a level of trusted connectivity from enterprise sources to a customer's IBM Cloud private network. There are offerings of IBM Cloud Direct Link (2.0) that are specifically tailored to every customer's workload requirements or business use case. Direct Link Connect is a bespoke solution for data center to data center connectivity (between clouds, or between on-premises and cloud), flexible bandwidth requirements, and multicloud environments. It also presents a lower cost of entry for IBM Cloud network customers compared to other Direct Link offerings. Direct Link Dedicated is built for customers that have high-volume workloads requiring very low latency, or for those clients rapidly moving data across multicloud environments. It satisfies stringent compliance requirements held by certain countries or industries. Dedicated also supports universal connectivity for either colocation or carrier. Dedicated Hosting options are also available for clients working with non-standard technologies (requiring bespoke networking solutions). Many such customers need to maintain and continue to leverage their existing IT investments, while investing into cloud-based technologies. Dedicated storage options are available in parallel for such customers. The connection point for Dedicated Hosting is adjacent to an IBM Cloud data center to provide optimal latency and performance. IBM Cloud's VPN access allows users to manage all servers remotely and securely over IBM Cloud's private network. A VPN connection from your location to the private network gives you the capability for out-of- band management and server rescue through an encrypted VPN tunnel. In this chapter, you will learn how to access a running instance by using secure socket shell (SSH) via the IBM Cloud Shell command line interface, taking a programmatic approach towards managing your PowerVS instance.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Part%205/02%20Access-instance/","text":"Accessing a PowerVS instance will depending on several factors, including the operating system the instance is running and the network connectivity available. Remote login tools like Secure Socket Shell (SSH), telnet, and other terminal emulators can be used to access instances. PowerVS also provides access to running instances using a web-based console tool. In most cases, clients will deploy PowerVS instances using a secured network like Direct Link or Virtual Private Network (VPN). Learn more about the PowerVS network connectivity options here . For this exercise, the IBM Cloud Shell will be used so no additional software is required. IBM Cloud Shell gives users complete control of their cloud resources, applications and infrastructure, from any web browser. IBM Cloud Shell provides pre-authenticated access to the latest tools and programming languages for cloud-based development, deployment and management of services and applications \u2014 all in a secure shell. IBM Cloud Shell is instantly accessible from the IBM Cloud portal. To quickly demonstrate the value of PowerVS, this demonstration environment and all running instances are provisioned with a public, Internet facing network interface. Follow the steps below to log in to a running PowerVS instance using the IBM Cloud Shell and SSH. You can learn more about SSH and SSH keys here . Change from your IBM Cloud account to the ITZ - ADHOC03 account using the drop-down switcher, as shown in the GIF below. Tip If your browser window is narrow, you may see this icon: instead of the current account name as shown in the screen capture above. Click the IBM Cloud Shell icon . The next steps are performed in using the IBM Cloud Shell window that was just opened. In the top-right corner of the IBM Cloud Shell window is a square icon with an \"up\" arrow. Click this button to upload a file \u2014 in this case, we will be uploading the SSH key you downloaded earlier in Step 5 . Locate the .pem file in your Downloads folder (or in the directory you saved it to previously) and then wait for the upload to finish. A dialogue box will appear in the bottom-right corner of the IBM Cloud Shell window letting you know when the upload is complete. With the Public SSH Key now uploaded into the IBM Cloud Shell environment, we need to decode it to base64 and\u2014 for ease of reference later \u2014assign the key a simple name such as mykey . Do so by issuing the following command into the IBM Cloud Shell prompt at the bottom of the window: base64 --decode ssh_private_key.pem > mykey Now adjust the access permissions on the mykey file using the following command: chmod 600 mykey We are now ready to remotely connect (SSH) to the PowerVS demonstration environment. Do so with the following command, substituting for the value recorded in Part 1 - Step 6 . You may receive a prompt asking whether you wish to continue connecting; if so, type Yes and then hit Return/Enter. ssh -i mykey <your_user_id>@52.117.41.110 Sample output Try running a few OS level commands using the following commands. ls -laR who ps -ef All of these commands are basic OS commands. If you are familiar with AIX or Linux, feel free to try other things out on the instance. Note, your user ID has limited permissions on all PowerVS instances in this shared environment. Administrative access is not provided. Close the SSH connection by running the exit command. exit To explore further, use the following public IP addresses to access the other PowerVM instances: Instance name Instance public IP address AIX-vm-1 52.117.41.110 AIX-vm-2 52.117.41.106 RH-vm-1 52.117.41.107 RH-vm-2 52.117.41.108 Use the ssh -i mykey UserName@IPaddress command to connect to the other servers. Be sure to replace UserName with the UserName field found in your TechZone reservation, and IPaddress with the instance's public IP address from the table above.

Mentioned earlier throughout this Level 3 course are the variety of features available for managing your PowerVS instance once the infrastructure and services have been deployed. The customizability and scalability of these environments post-launch are precisely the \"cloud-centric\" benefits that draw customers towards an investment in PowerVS. In this chapter, we'll dive deeper into each of these advanced topics to get you up to speed on the fundamentals and provide a launching point for you to craft bespoke demonstrations on these topics for your client engagements. Specifically, you will examine each of the four categories in turn: server placement groups; storage solutions including volumes, boot volumes, and images; networking topics including subnets, cloud connections, and VPN connections; and additional services available from the IBM Cloud catalog. Server placement groups deliver high availability (HA) for your PowerVS instance within a data center, either on the same (affinity configuration) or separate (anti-affinity configuration) physical servers. Every instance of IBM PowerVS consists of a mandatory boot volume (via IBM Cloud Object Storage buckets) and has the option for additional storage volumes, should a client require more. Boot images can also be supplied for provisioning new instances. You'll explore the variety of options available through the IBM Cloud web interface. Subnets are an important part of how you use the internet, and that's also true when using IBM Cloud. We have specific terminology for the types and uses of subnets found in our platform. Each subnet provides IP addresses to resources in different ways. By knowing more about each type of subnet, you can understand how to best make use of them in your cloud infrastructure. Primary subnets are subnets assigned to meet the IP addressing needs of other products, such as bare metal server and virtual server instances. These subnets are automatically assigned and removed. Secondary subnets are subnets which are purchased and routed by you, cancelled when no longer needed. There are two types: portable and static. Portable IP addresses are available to all resources on a VLAN, whereas static IP addresses are available to the resource identified as their routing endpoint. Global IP addresses's unique routing behavior utilizes IBM's Cloud backbone to provide IP addresses to the resources identified as the routing endpoint. Cloud connections and VPN connections were introduced earlier in Part 5, but options around how they are provisioned and added to a PowerVS instance will be explored more deeply in this chapter.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Part%206/02%20ServerPlacementGroups/","text":"Server placement groups provide control over the host or server on which a new instance is placed. By using server placement groups, high availability within a data center can be achieved. When a placement group is set with an affinity policy, all instances in that placement group are launched on the same physical server. When a placement group is set with an anti-affinity policy, all instances in that placement group are launched on different servers. A few facts about server placement groups: By default, there is a maximum of 25 server placement groups. A support ticket needs to be raised to go beyond this limit. The IBM Cloud Portal for server placement groups can only be used if the cloud account has less than 100 instances. If the account has > 100 instances, the command line interfaces (CLI) or application programming interfaces (API) must be used to create server placement groups.

Every instance consists of a boot volume and optionally additional storage volumes. While IBM manages the underlying physical storage, it is the client's responsibility to manage and protect the data on instances. A few facts about storage volumes: - Storage volumes can be increased in size in 1GB increments, but not decreased. - Storage volume sizes maximums will depend on availability within the selected IBM datacenter. - Storage volumes can be marked as shareable . - Storage volumes can be marked as bootable . - Affinity and anti-affinity rules can be applied to storage volumes. A few facts about boot volumes/images: Boot volumes can be imported from IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS). Boot volumes can be exported to IBM COS. Affinity and anti-affinity rules can be applied to boot volumes. Boot volumes (and storage volumes) of running instances can be captured (also know as a snapshot) to either the local image catalog associated with the PowerVS service or to IBM COS. Captured boot images can be used to provision new instances. In the TechZone environment: Explore the Storage volumes page in the IBM Cloud Portal.

IBM Power Systems Virtual Server provides command line interfaces (CLI) as a plugin to the IBM Cloud CLI. The PowerVS CLIs provide system administrators the ability to programmatically manage their PowerVS environment with out having to use the IBM Cloud Portal. In this chapter, you will explore a variety of CLI instructions that can be issued via the IBM Cloud Shell portal (or any SSH connection) for administration of a PowerVS instance. Topics include: Inspection of all PowerVS services provisioned under your IBM Cloud account Setting the service target of the IBM Cloud Shell to the instance ID of your PowerVS environment Setting the target of future PowerVS plugin commands to an environment variable Inspection of the four virtual machines (VMs) provisioned as part of your PowerVS environment, including AIX and RHEL Restarting a virtual machine programmatically Generating an SSH private key for managing your PowerVS environment As you will see, there are hundreds of potential CLI instructions which can be issued \u2014 our goal is not to be exhaustive and not go into every command in detail, but rather provide you with a representative sampling of jobs that can be performed programmatically via the CLI. Using this foundational knowledge, you will be prepared to craft more tailored demonstrations and tasks with your clients.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Part%207/02%20CLIs/","text":"In this exercise, explore several of the PowerVS CLIs. It is important to remember you are using a shared environment and have limited administrative permissions. The CLIs being executed here are command that only require \"read\" access to the environment. CLIs also exist to create and modify the PowerVS resources, you will just not have sufficient permissions to execute those commands in the shared environment. Attempting to do so will result in an error. For this exercise, the IBM Cloud Shell will be used. IBM Cloud Shell gives users complete control of their cloud resources, applications and infrastructure, from any web browser. IBM Cloud Shell provides pre-authenticated access to the latest tools and programming languages for cloud-based development, deployment and management of services and applications \u2014 all in a secure shell. IBM Cloud Shell is instantly accessible from the IBM Cloud portal. The IBM command line interface (CLI) along with all the IBM Cloud CLI plugins are pre-installed in IBM Cloud Shell, including the PowerVS CLIs. It is also possible to install the IBM Cloud CLIs and PowerVS CLI plugin other systems, like personal desktops, development servers, etc. To learn more about installing the PowerVS CLI locally click here . To get started, first open the IBM Cloud Shell from the IBM Cloud portal: If not already opened, open the IBM Cloud Portal: https://cloud.ibm.com/ and authenticate with your IBM Cloud credentials. Change from your IBM Cloud account to the 2305900 - ITZ - ADHOC03 account. Tip If your browser window is narrow, you may see this icon: instead of the current account name as shown in the screen capture above. Click the IBM Cloud Shell icon . The next steps are performed in using the IBM Cloud Shell window that was opened. First, create a SSH private key file using the key provided in your IBM Technology Zone's reservation welcome e-mail. Remember, to avoid typographical errors copy the command line using the icon when it is available. Then paste the contents into the IBM Cloud Shell using Ctrl +v , Cmd +v , or right click and select paste at the prompt in the IBM Cloud Shell. Display all the PowerVS plugin command line options. ibmcloud pi --help | more Tip for novice Linux users! If you are not familiar with Linux commands, don't worry. The command you just ran is actually 2 commands. The first is ibmcloud pi --help . This executes the help option of the PowerVS plugin. The second command is the more command which pauses the output being displayed. The \"|\" or pipe character takes the output from the first command and sends it as input to the second command. If you want to learn more about Linux commands, just do a Internet search on Linux primer . Press the space bar to continue the output. You may need to press space bar several times to cycle through the complete output. Notice the last part of the message says: Enter 'ibmcloud pi help [command]' for more information about a command. Use this to get more help on individual PowerVS plugin commands. List all the PowerVS services provisioned in the account. ibmcloud pi service-list Sample output To view the PowerVS instances in the service, the service target must first be set for the PowerVS plugin. Set the service target using the instance ID of the service. serviceID=`ibmcloud pi service-list 2>&1 | tail -1 | cut -f1 -d' '` Tip for novice Linux users! The last command did 4 actions. First, it listed the service list like in step 6 and redirected both the error and standard output to the standard output stream ( 2>&1 ). This output was then sent to the tail command which ignores everything but the last line ( -1 ). Then the output from the tail command is sent to the cut command where all the output except the first field up to to the first space character is ignored ( -f -d' ' ). And finally, the output from the cut command was stored in an environment variable called serviceID . Why did we do this? Because no one wants to type crn:v1:bluemix:public:power-iaas:us-south:a/ba0e33c9056f470ca19de009747ec654:c8bee9ba-f208-442c-9e10-5633624d633f:: in order to run the next command. Use the $serviceID environment variable to set the target of future PowerVS plugin commands to the service. ibmcloud pi service-target $serviceID Sample output List all the PowerVS instances provisioned in the targeted PowerVS service. ibmcloud pi instances Sample output View the details of the AIX-vm-1 instance. ibmcloud pi instance AIX-vm-1 Sample output Thus far, all of these commands have been read commands. The PowerVS CLIs also support create and update commands, but remember your user ID has limited access. Try the instance modify command and see what happens. Hint : Business Partners should record the value of the Storage Pool Affinity field in the output from the above command. Recall that our Power environment consists of a total of 4 PowerVM instances: AIX-vm-1, AIX-vm-2, RH-vm-1, and RH-vm2. Up until now we've primarily been issuing instructions to perform work against AIX-vm-1. Given that the testing environment is primarily limited to read-only actions, let's inspect one of the other VMs and determine what (if any) differences exist between the various instances. Issue the following command to the IBM Cloud Shell: ibmcloud pi instance RH-vm-1 And then issue a second command: ibmcloud pi instance AIX-vm-1 You'll notice that the two tables are nearly identical, save for a single field at the bottom of the AIX-vm-1 inspection output. There are numerous reasons why you might want to generate an SSH private key for managing your PowerVS environment. In fact, that's exactly what the service's administrators did in order to authorize your access to the PowerVS instance \u2014 you'll recall how you first connected to the PowerVS virtual machines remotely via the IBM Cloud Shell with the supplied key information. The IBM Cloud Shell is capable of generating an SSH key that is configured for password-less authentication (in other words, allowing users to authenticate without needing to also supply a password). You can do so using the Shell, or any Linux environment, using the following ssh-keygen command: ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N '' -f newKey Sample output You can then use IBM Power CLIs to create a key for the instance using an imported RSA public key, which you will specify the key pair you generated a moment ago as the source. Do so using the following command. (Note: newKeyPOWER is the name of the IBM Power CLI-generated key that is to be created; newKey is the SSH key generated earlier using the IBM Cloud Shell). SSH keys Be aware that the SSH key-pair generated and assigned by this step is specific to IBM Power Systems. These are distinct from ones you generated previously using the IBM Cloud Shell. ibmcloud pi keyc newKeyPOWER --key newKey Sample output As you might have expected, the instruction fails to execute because of insufficient (locked down) permissions within this testing environment. Go ahead and experiment with other IBM Power CLIs. Many instructions and commands will meet with similar results, but it nevertheless is good practice given that there is no risk to the system within this sandbox environment. Restart the RH-vm-1 instance. ibmcloud pi instance-soft-reboot RH-vm-1 Sample output Note, this error message as nowhere near as informative as what you saw in the IBM Cloud portal when attempting an action your user ID does not have permission to perform. The product team has been notified, and hopefully in the near future the CLI error messages will improve. There are over 100 PowerVS CLIs. Feel free to explore these using your TechZone environment. Remember, use ibmcloud pi --help or ibmcloud pi <command> --help to get detailed information on a command's usage.
