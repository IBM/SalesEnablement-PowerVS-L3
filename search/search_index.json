These environments operate in their own pod and the internal networks are fenced; however, they still offer connectivity options to meet customer requirements, including public internet. This carefully calibrated infrastructure enables Power Systems Virtual Server to maintain key enterprise software certification and support that customers would receive with on-premises infrastructure, but with the added flexibility and capabilities that come from an IBM Cloud deployment.</p> <p>The IBM Power Systems Virtual Server service, allows users to quickly create and deploy one or more virtual servers (that are running either the AIX, IBM i, or Linux operating systems). After provisioning the Power Systems Virtual Server, users get access to infrastructure and physical computing resources without the need to manage or operate them. However, users must manage the operating system and the software applications and data. Given that this course is primarily a demonstration of infrastructure as a service, the guide does not delve deeply into the application layer or the day to day administrative tasks. The guide will explore the fundamentals of working with AIX and Linux atop of IBM Power Systems Virtual Server.</p> <p>Before creating a PowerVS virtual server, understand the difference in terminology between a PowerVS service and a PowerVS instance. Think of the PowerVS service as a container for all PowerVS instances at a specific geographic region. PowerVS instances are virtual machines (VMs). The service is available from the Resource List in the IBM Cloud Portal. For example, a Cloud account can have multiple PowerVS services: one in Dallas, Texas, and another in Washington, D.C. Each service can contain multiple instances. A service must be associated with an IBM Cloud resource group which helps in grouping resources and assigning permissions. To learn more, refer to Getting Started with IBM Power Systems Virtual Server.</p> <p>The key parameters for a PowerVS service are:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Datacenter location: As of August 2022, PowerVS is co-located with 15 IBM Cloud datacenters located around the world. When selecting a datacenter, consider choosing the datacenter located nearest the majority of the end users that will be accessing the workloads running in PowerVS.</p> </li> <li> <p>Service name: The PowerVS service name will appear in the IBM Cloud Portal under the provisioned services. Specify a name that is easily understood and recognized.</p> </li> <li> <p>Resource group: Resource groups are used to organize resources in an IBM Cloud account. Administrative and access rights for all PowerVS resources are associated with the PowerVS service and not individual PowerVS instances (VMs). Once a PowerVS service is assigned to a resource group, the resource group cannot be changed.</p> </li> </ul> <p>In the chapter to follow, view a video of a PowerVS server being provisioned and replicate the steps taken using a click-through guided demonstration.</p>"},{"location":"Part%202/02%20Watch-service/","title":"Watch a service being provisioned","text":"<p>In this chapter, watch a video of an IBM Power Systems Virtual Server service being provisioned in the IBM Cloud Portal.</p> <p>This video includes audio that explains the steps being taken and things to consider while making choices on options.

The environment is in its own pod and the internal networks are fenced but offer connectivity options to meet customer requirements. This infrastructure design enables IBM Power Systems Virtual Server to maintain key enterprise software certification and support as the PowerVS architecture is identical to certified on-premises infrastructure. The virtual servers, also known as instances, logical partitions (LPAR), or virtual machines (VMs) run on IBM Power Systems hardware with the PowerVM hypervisor.</p> <p>The key parameters for a PowerVS instance are:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Instance name: The PowerVS instance name will appear in the IBM Cloud Portal under the list of instances within a service. Specify a name that is easily understood and recognized.</p> </li> <li> <p>Server placement group: Server placement groups provide control over the host or server on which a new virtual machine (VM) is placed. By using server placement groups, high availability solutions can be created within a data center. Apply an affinity or anti-affinity policy to each VM instance within a server placement group. After creating a placement group, provision a new VM instance in the placement group. When setting a placement group with an affinity policy, all VMs in that placement group are launched on the same server. When setting a placement group with an anti-affinity policy, all VMs in that placement group are launched on different servers. Learn more about placement groups.</p> </li> <li> <p>VM pinning policy: VM pinning controls the movement of VMs during disasters and other restart events. Learn more about hard and soft pinning here.</p> </li> <li> <p>SSH key: An SSH public/private key pair is required to access the instance. An SSH key must be created and loaded into the IBM Cloud Portal prior to creating an instance. Learn more about using and generating SSH keys here.</p> </li> <li> <p>Operating system: PowerVS instances can run either IBM AIX, IBM i, or Linux operating systems (OS). Several Linux images are available specifically for servers that will run SAP.</p> </li> <li> <p>OS image: Users have the ability to choose an operating system image from the PowerVS image catalog or users can bring their own image. Each supported OS has a specific set of images in the PowerVS catalog for supported OS versions. Each instance is provisioned with a boot volume using the storage tier selected.</p> </li> <li> <p>Storage tier: PowerVS supports both Tier 1 and Tier 3 storage. Tier 1 provides a maximum of 10 input/output operations per second (IOPs) per GB, while Tier 3 provides a maximum of 3 IOPS/GB. Tier 3 storage should only be utilized for non-production workloads.</p> </li> <li> <p>Storage pool affinity: Three storage pool affinity options are available: auto-select, affinity, and anti-affinity. The affinity option requires the boot volume to be placed in the same pool as another existing instance or existing boot volume. The new storage volume(s) for the instance will be placed in the same storage pool where the affinity object resides. The anti-affinity specifies a different pool should be used from that of another existing instance or existing boot volume.</p> </li> <li> <p>Machine type: Two IBM Power Systems machine types are supported: s922 and e980. Learn more about these s922 here and the e980 here.</p> </li> <li> <p>Core type: PowerVS supports shared uncapped, shared capped, and dedicated cores. Shared uncapped cores are shared among other clients. Shared capped cores are shared, but resources do not expand beyond those that are requested (used mostly for licensing). Dedicated cores are allocated for a specific client (used for specific third-party licensing considerations). Learn more about core types here.</p> </li> <li> <p>Number of cores: The option for the number of cores assigned to an instance depends on the core type. Shared capped and unshared capped cores support 0.25 core increments, while dedicated cores must be assigned a full core. Note, the maximum number of cores will depend on the machine type and availability in the selected location.</p> </li> <li> <p>Amount of memory: PowerVS instances must be provisioned with a minimum of 2GB of random access memory (RAM). The maximum amount of memory varies based upon machine type and availability in the selected location. If greater than 64GB RAM per core is specified, a higher price is charged.</p> </li> <li> <p>Additional storage volumes: When provisioning a new instance, for additional storage, a new data volume can be created or an existing volume can be attached. Any storage volume added at this time will use the same storage tier as the boot volume specified earlier.</p> </li> <li> <p>Networking: PowerVS instances will always be attached to a private network and can optionally be attached to a public, Internet accessible network. Use private networks to connect to existing subnets or go a new subnet can be created.

PowerVS allows clients to rapidly provision new instances running AIX, IBM i, or Linux. Ultimately, clients will want to deploy applications on those machines. The applications that clients choose to deploy will vary widely. They may include middleware like databases, third party software products like SAP, or applications they have developed themselves. To install these applications, they need to access the instance and install the software.</p> <p>A fundamental challenge that every customer examining an expansion to cloud will face is how to connect their on-premises data sources with off-premises (cloud-based) resources and services. Doing so securely, efficiently, and cost-effectively is undeniably a challenge for organizations of every size, whether they are a mid-sized business or an enterprise company.</p> <p>There are 3 main methods to used:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Via the public internet</p> </li> <li> <p>Via a VPN tunnel</p> </li> <li> <p>Via IBM Cloud Direct Link (2.0)</p> </li> </ol> <p>In most cases, clients will deploy PowerVS instances using a secured network like Direct Link or Virtual Private Network (VPN).</p> <p>IBM Cloud Direct Link (2.0) provides a level of trusted connectivity from enterprise sources to a customer's IBM Cloud private network. There are offerings of IBM Cloud Direct Link (2.0) that are specifically tailored to every customer's workload requirements or business use case.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Direct Link Connect is a bespoke solution for data center to data center connectivity (between clouds, or between on-premises and cloud), flexible bandwidth requirements, and multicloud environments. It also presents a lower cost of entry for IBM Cloud network customers compared to other Direct Link offerings.</p> </li> <li> <p>Direct Link Dedicated is built for customers that have high-volume workloads requiring very low latency, or for those clients rapidly moving data across multicloud environments. It satisfies stringent compliance requirements held by certain countries or industries. Dedicated also supports universal connectivity for either colocation or carrier.</p> </li> <li> <p>Dedicated Hosting options are also available for clients working with non-standard technologies (requiring bespoke networking solutions). Many such customers need to maintain and continue to leverage their existing IT investments, while investing into cloud-based technologies. Dedicated storage options are available in parallel for such customers. The connection point for Dedicated Hosting is adjacent to an IBM Cloud data center to provide optimal latency and performance.</p> </li> <li> <p>IBM Cloud's VPN access allows users to manage all servers remotely and securely over IBM Cloud's private network. A VPN connection from a remote location to the private network gives the capability for out-of-band management and server rescue through an encrypted VPN tunnel.</p> </li> </ul> <p>In this chapter, learn how to access a running instance by using secure socket shell (SSH) via the IBM Cloud Shell command line interface, taking a programmatic approach towards managing PowerVS instances.</p>"},{"location":"Part%205/02%20Access-instance/","title":"Access an instance","text":"<p>Accessing a PowerVS instance will depend on several factors, including the operating system the instance is running and the network connectivity available.

The customizability and scalability of these environments post-launch are precisely the \"cloud-centric\" benefits that draw customers towards an investment in PowerVS. In this chapter, we'll dive deeper into each of these advanced topics to get you up to speed on the fundamentals and provide a launching point for you to craft bespoke demonstrations on these topics for your client engagements.</p> <p>Specifically, you will examine each of the four categories in turn: server placement groups; storage solutions including volumes, boot volumes, and images; networking topics including subnets, cloud connections, and VPN connections; and additional services available from the IBM Cloud catalog.</p> <p>Server placement groups deliver high availability (HA) for your PowerVS instance within a data center, either on the same (affinity configuration) or separate (anti-affinity configuration) physical servers.</p> <p>Every instance of IBM PowerVS consists of a mandatory boot volume (via IBM Cloud Object Storage buckets) and has the option for additional storage volumes, should a client require more. Boot images can also be supplied for provisioning new instances. You'll explore the variety of options available through the IBM Cloud web interface.</p> <p>Subnets are an important part of how you use the internet, and that's also true when using IBM Cloud. We have specific terminology for the types and uses of subnets found in our platform. Each subnet provides IP addresses to resources in different ways. By knowing more about each type of subnet, you can understand how to best make use of them in your cloud infrastructure.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Primary subnets are subnets assigned to meet the IP addressing needs of other products, such as bare metal server and virtual server instances. These subnets are automatically assigned and removed.</p> </li> <li> <p>Secondary subnets are subnets which are purchased and routed by you, cancelled when no longer needed. There are two types: portable and static. Portable IP addresses are available to all resources on a VLAN, whereas static IP addresses are available to the resource identified as their routing endpoint. Global IP addresses's unique routing behavior utilizes IBM's Cloud backbone to provide IP addresses to the resources identified as the routing endpoint.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Cloud connections and VPN connections were introduced earlier in Part 5, but options around how they are provisioned and added to a PowerVS instance will be explored more deeply in this chapter.</p>"},{"location":"Part%206/02%20ServerPlacementGroups/","title":"Server placement groups","text":"<p>Server placement groups provide control over the host or server on which a new instance is placed.
