You should be familiar with PowerVS and should have completed the IBM Power Systems Virtual Server Sales Foundation Badge. This demonstration environment has a dual purpose. First, it is meant to educate you on IBM Power Systems Virtual Server and how to demonstrate some of the capabilities of PowerVS to clients. Second, the environment can be used for client demonstrations. After you are familiar with the content, get in front of a client and show the power of IBM Power Systems Virtual Server. Important The focus of the demonstration is on the Infrastructure as a Service capability of PowerVS and not on the operating systems supported by the offering: AIX, IBM i, and Linux. In the next part of the demonstration script, learn what about PowerVS service instances and how they are provisioned.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Part%202/01.01%20Introduction/","text":"Many IBM Cloud services are enabled for IBM Cloud Satellite including IBM Cloud databases, IBM Event Streams, IBM Key Protect, Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud, and others. In the future, more services will be enabled for IBM Cloud Satellite. In this part of the demonstration, you will learn how to find the IBM Cloud services that are enabled for Satellite using the IBM Cloud portal. In addition, you will see how Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud was provisioned in this demonstration environment, and how you can demonstrate this process. Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud is a fully managed deployment of Red Hat OpenShift that is managed by IBM. In this demonstration environment, the OpenShift cluster has already been deployed to the IBM Cloud Satellite Location running in AWS. In the next chapters, you will learn how this was done and how you can demonstrate this to your client. Note, when originally provisioned, the fully automated process took approximately 45 minutes from start to finish. The cluster that was deployed has 9 worker nodes (labeled as additional hosts in the image below), 3 per availability zone in the Satellite Location. The Satellite Control Plane also acts as the master nodes for this cluster. The logical deployment architecture is depicted below. Note: the public facing IP addresses for both the additional hosts (aka worker nodes) and the satellite control plane hosts in AWS have been exposed for the purposes of this demonstration. For proof-of-concepts (POCs) or production environments, a best practice would be to use the private IP addresses and Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to establish connectivity. You can read more about this in the IBM Cloud Satellite documentation .","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Part%203/01.01%20Introduction/","text":"IBM Cloud Satellite provides the ability to deploy Kubernetes resources to Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud clusters that run in IBM Cloud, IBM Cloud Satellite Locations, and on-premises. This capability is called Satellite Config. You can learn more about Satellite Config here . Satellite Config is a continuous delivery tool based on the Razee open source project. You can learn more about Razee here . You already learned about Locations and Clusters , but there are additional Satellite key concepts you should be familiar with. They are: Cluster groups A cluster group specifies a set of Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud clusters that are registered with the Satellite Config component and that are included in a Satellite configuration. Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud clusters that run in your location are automatically registered and can be added to a cluster group. Clusters that run in IBM Cloud must be manually registered with the Satellite Config component before you can add them to a cluster group. Links With Satellite Link endpoints, you can allow software that runs in your Satellite location to connect to a service, server, or application that runs outside of the Satellite Location. Links can also allow software that is connected to the IBM Cloud private network to connect to a service, server, or application that runs in your Satellite Location. To establish the connection, you must specify the destination resource's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or IP address, port, the connection protocol, and any authentication methods at the endpoint. The endpoint is registered with the Satellite Link component of your Location's Satellite control plane. To help you maintain enterprise security and audit compliance, Satellite Link additionally provides built-in controls to restrict client access to endpoints, and to log and audit traffic that flows over endpoints. Satellite Links are not used in these demonstrations but are an important concept to understand. For more information on Links, read the documentation here . Configuration A Satellite configurations, also referred to as Satellite Conifg , is a continuous delivery tool that you can use to consistently roll out versions of your apps across clusters in your Satellite location. For more information, see Deploying Red Hat OpenShift resources across clusters with Satellite configurations . Version A version represents a Kubernetes resource file that you upload or manually create for a Satellite configuration. You can include any Kubernetes resource in your version and upload as many versions to a configuration as you like. Kubernetes uses YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) for resource files. For help developing a Kubernetes YAML resource file, see Developing apps to run on OpenShift . Subscription A Satellite subscription is created for a Satellite configuration and specifies which version of the Kubernetes resource that you uploaded is deployed to one or more cluster groups. The Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud clusters in your cluster group can exist in your Satellite Location or in IBM Cloud. Up until now, the demonstrations you have gone through have been focused on creating satellite locations and deploying Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud to a Satellite Location. In this part, you will learn to demonstrate one of the key business values of IBM Cloud Satellite ... the ability to easily deploy and update applications across IBM Cloud Satellite Locations. Info The images in this demonstration guide may differ from what you see when performing the steps. This will typically be due to changes in the IBM Cloud portal user interface, additional objects in lists, etc. These differences should not affect the demonstration.","title":"Introduction"}]}
