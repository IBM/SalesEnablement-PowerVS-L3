Power Systems Virtual Servers are located across IBM data centers, distinct from the IBM Cloud servers with separate networks and direct-attached storage. These environments operate in their own pod and the internal networks are fenced; however, they still offer connectivity options to meet customer requirements, including public internet. This carefully calibrated infrastructure enables Power Systems Virtual Server to maintain key enterprise software certification and support that customers would receive with on-premises infrastructure, but with the added flexibility and capabilities that come from an IBM Cloud deployment. The IBM Power Systems Virtual Server service, allows users to quickly create and deploy one or more virtual servers (that are running either the AIX, IBM i, or Linux operating systems). After provisioning the Power Systems Virtual Server, users get access to infrastructure and physical computing resources without the need to manage or operate them. However, users must manage the operating system and the software applications and data. Given that this course is primarily a demonstration of infrastructure as a service, the guide does not delve deeply into the application layer or the day to day administrative tasks. The guide will explore the fundamentals of working with AIX and Linux atop of IBM Power Systems Virtual Server. Before creating a PowerVS virtual server, understand the difference in terminology between a PowerVS service and a PowerVS instance . Think of the PowerVS service as a container for all PowerVS instances at a specific geographic region. PowerVS instances are virtual machines (VMs). The service is available from the Resource List in the IBM Cloud Portal. For example, a Cloud account can have multiple PowerVS services: one in Dallas, Texas, and another in Washington, D.C. Each service can contain multiple instances. A service must be associated with an IBM Cloud resource group which helps in grouping resources and assigning permissions. To learn more, refer to Getting Started with IBM Power Systems Virtual Server . The key parameters for a PowerVS service are: Datacenter location : As of August 2022, PowerVS is co-located with 15 IBM Cloud datacenters located around the world. When selecting a datacenter, consider choosing the datacenter located nearest the majority of the end users that will be accessing the workloads running in PowerVS. Service name : The PowerVS service name will appear in the IBM Cloud Portal under the provisioned services. Specify a name that is easily understood and recognized. Resource group : Resource groups are used to organize resources in an IBM Cloud account. Administrative and access rights for all PowerVS resources are associated with the PowerVS service and not individual PowerVS instances (VMs). Once a PowerVS service is assigned to a resource group, the resource group cannot be changed.

IBM Systems Virtual Servers are located in the IBM data centers, distinct from the IBM Cloud servers with separate networks and direct-attached storage. The environment is in its own pod and the internal networks are fenced but offer connectivity options to meet customer requirements. This infrastructure design enables IBM Power Systems Virtual Server to maintain key enterprise software certification and support as the PowerVS architecture is identical to certified on-premises infrastructure. The virtual servers, also known as instances, logical partitions (LPAR), or virtual machines (VMs) run on IBM Power Systems hardware with the PowerVM hypervisor. The key parameters for a PowerVS instance are: Instance name : The PowerVS instance name will appear in the IBM Cloud Portal under the list of instances within a service. Specify a name that is easily understood and recognized. Server placement group : Server placement groups provide control over the host or server on which a new virtual machine (VM) is placed. By using server placement groups, high availability solutions can be created within a data center. Apply an affinity or anti-affinity policy to each VM instance within a server placement group. After creating a placement group, provision a new VM instance in the placement group. When setting a placement group with an affinity policy, all VMs in that placement group are launched on the same server. When setting a placement group with an anti-affinity policy, all VMs in that placement group are launched on different servers. Learn more about placement groups . VM pinning policy : VM pinning controls the movement of VMs during disasters and other restart events. Learn more about hard and soft pinning here . SSH key : An SSH public/private key pair is required to access the instance. An SSH key must be created and loaded into the IBM Cloud Portal prior to creating an instance. Learn more about using and generating SSH keys here . Operating system : PowerVS instances can run either IBM AIX, IBM i, or Linux operating systems (OS). Several Linux images are available specifically for servers that will run SAP. OS image : Users have the ability to choose an operating system image from the PowerVS image catalog or users can bring their own image. Each supported OS has a specific set of images in the PowerVS catalog for supported OS versions. Each instance is provisioned with a boot volume using the storage tier selected. Storage tier : PowerVS supports both Tier 1 and Tier 3 storage. Tier 1 provides a maximum of 100 input/output operations per second (IOPs) per GB, while Tier 3 provides a maximum of 3 IOPS/GB. Tier 3 storage should only be utilized for non-production workloads. Storage pool affinity : Three storage pool affinity options are available: auto-select, affinity, and anti-affinity. The affinity option requires the boot volume to be placed in the same pool as another existing instance or existing boot volume. The new storage volume(s) for the instance will be placed in the same storage pool where the affinity object resides. The anti-affinity specifies a different pool should be used from that of another existing instance or existing boot volume. Machine type : Two IBM Power Systems machine types are supported: s922 and e980. Learn more about these s922 here and the e980 here . Core type : PowerVS supports shared uncapped, shared capped, and dedicated cores. Shared uncapped cores are shared among other clients. Shared capped cores are shared, but resources do not expand beyond those that are requested (used mostly for licensing). Dedicated cores are allocated for a specific client (used for specific third-party licensing considerations). Learn more about core types here . Number of cores : The option for the number of cores assigned to an instance depends on the core type. Shared capped and unshared capped cores support 0.25 core increments, while dedicated cores must be assigned a full core. Note, the maximum number of cores will depend on the machine type and availability in the selected location. Amount of memory : PowerVS instances must be provisioned with a minimum of 2GB of random access memory (RAM). The maximum amount of memory varies based upon machine type and availability in the selected location. If greater than 64GB RAM per core is specified, a higher price is charged. Additional storage volumes : When provisioning a new instance, for additional storage, a new data volume can be created or an existing volume can be attached. Any storage volume added at this time will use the same storage tier as the boot volume specified earlier. Networking : PowerVS instances will always be attached to a private network and can optionally be attached to a public, Internet accessible network. Use private networks to connect to existing subnets or go a new subnet can be created. Learn more about PowerVS networking here .

IBM Power Systems Virtual Server is an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offering. PowerVS allows clients to rapidly provision new instances running AIX, IBM i, or Linux. Ultimately, clients will want to deploy applications on those machines. The applications that clients choose to deploy will vary widely. They may include middleware like databases, third party software products like SAP, or applications they have developed themselves. To install these applications, they need to access the instance and install the software. A fundamental challenge that every customer examining an expansion to cloud will face is how to connect their on-premises data sources with off-premises (cloud-based) resources and services. Doing so securely, efficiently, and cost-effectively is undeniably a challenge for organizations of every size, whether they are a mid-sized business or an enterprise company. There are 3 main methods to used: Via the public internet Via a VPN tunnel Via IBM Cloud Direct Link (2.0) In most cases, clients will deploy PowerVS instances using a secured network like Direct Link or Virtual Private Network (VPN). IBM Cloud Direct Link (2.0) provides a level of trusted connectivity from enterprise sources to a customer's IBM Cloud private network. There are offerings of IBM Cloud Direct Link (2.0) that are specifically tailored to every customer's workload requirements or business use case. Direct Link Connect is a bespoke solution for data center to data center connectivity (between clouds, or between on-premises and cloud), flexible bandwidth requirements, and multicloud environments. It also presents a lower cost of entry for IBM Cloud network customers compared to other Direct Link offerings. Direct Link Dedicated is built for customers that have high-volume workloads requiring very low latency, or for those clients rapidly moving data across multicloud environments. It satisfies stringent compliance requirements held by certain countries or industries. Dedicated also supports universal connectivity for either colocation or carrier. Dedicated Hosting options are also available for clients working with non-standard technologies (requiring bespoke networking solutions). Many such customers need to maintain and continue to leverage their existing IT investments, while investing into cloud-based technologies. Dedicated storage options are available in parallel for such customers. The connection point for Dedicated Hosting is adjacent to an IBM Cloud data center to provide optimal latency and performance. IBM Cloud's VPN access allows users to manage all servers remotely and securely over IBM Cloud's private network. A VPN connection from a remote location to the private network gives the capability for out-of-band management and server rescue through an encrypted VPN tunnel.

To quickly demonstrate the value of PowerVS, this demonstration environment and all running instances are provisioned with a public, Internet facing network interface. Follow the steps below to log in to a running PowerVS instance using the IBM Cloud Shell and SSH. You can learn more about SSH and SSH keys here . Change to the ITZ - ADHOC03 account using the drop-down switcher, as shown in the GIF below. Tip If the browser window is narrow, this icon: may appear instead of the current account name as shown in the screen capture above. Click the IBM Cloud Shell icon . The next steps are performed in using the IBM Cloud Shell window that was just opened. In the top-right corner of the IBM Cloud Shell window is a square icon with an \"up\" arrow. Click this button to upload a file \u2014 upload the SSH key downloaded earlier. Locate the .pem file in Downloads folder specified earlier and wait for the transfer to finish. A dialogue box will appear in the bottom-right corner of the IBM Cloud Shell window when the upload is complete. With the Public SSH Key now uploaded into the IBM Cloud Shell environment, we need to decode it to base64 and\u2014 for ease of reference later \u2014assign the key a simple name such as mykey . Do so by issuing the following command into the IBM Cloud Shell prompt at the bottom of the window: base64 --decode ssh_private_key.pem > mykey Now adjust the access permissions on the mykey file using the following command: chmod 600 mykey We are now ready to remotely connect (SSH) to the PowerVS demonstration environment. Do so with the following command, substituting for the value recorded in Part 1 - Step 6 . A prompt asking whether to continue connecting may appear; if so, type Yes and then hit Return/Enter. Ignore the message regarding authenticity of the host not being established. ssh -i mykey <your_user_id>@52.117.41.110 Sample output Try running a few OS level commands using the following commands. ls -laR who ps -ef All of these commands are basic OS commands. If familiar with AIX or Linux, feel free to try other things out on the instance. Note, users of the shared environment have limited permissions on the PowerVS instances. Administrative access is not provided. Close the SSH connection by running the exit command. exit To explore further, use the following public IP addresses to access the other PowerVM instances: Instance name Instance public IP address AIX-vm-1 52.117.41.110 AIX-vm-2 52.117.41.106 RH-vm-1 52.117.41.107 RH-vm-2 52.117.41.108 Use the ssh -i mykey UserName@IPaddress command to connect to the other servers. Be sure to replace UserName with the UserName field found in the TechZone reservation, and IPaddress with the instance's public IP address from the table above. Technical sellers should proceed to Part 6 and explore PowerVS server placement groups, volumes, subnets, and additional services. That concludes the required parts of the demonstration script for IBM and Business Partners Sales. All are encouraged to complete Parts 6 and 7, but at this time IBM and Business Partners Sales may skip to Part 8 - Next steps .","title":"Access an instance"},{"location":"Part%206/01%20Introduction/","text":"Ways to Watch In addition to the embedded video, IBMers and Business Partners can also download the recording from Seismic . Mentioned earlier throughout this Level 3 course are the variety of features available for managing your PowerVS instance once the infrastructure and services have been deployed. The customizability and scalability of these environments post-launch are precisely the \"cloud-centric\" benefits that draw customers towards an investment in PowerVS. In this chapter, we'll dive deeper into each of these advanced topics to get you up to speed on the fundamentals and provide a launching point for you to craft bespoke demonstrations on these topics for your client engagements. Specifically, you will examine each of the four categories in turn: server placement groups; storage solutions including volumes, boot volumes, and images; networking topics including subnets, cloud connections, and VPN connections; and additional services available from the IBM Cloud catalog. Server placement groups deliver high availability (HA) for your PowerVS instance within a data center, either on the same (affinity configuration) or separate (anti-affinity configuration) physical servers. Every instance of IBM PowerVS consists of a mandatory boot volume (via IBM Cloud Object Storage buckets) and has the option for additional storage volumes, should a client require more. Boot images can also be supplied for provisioning new instances. You'll explore the variety of options available through the IBM Cloud web interface. Subnets are an important part of how you use the internet, and that's also true when using IBM Cloud. We have specific terminology for the types and uses of subnets found in our platform. Each subnet provides IP addresses to resources in different ways. By knowing more about each type of subnet, you can understand how to best make use of them in your cloud infrastructure. Primary subnets are subnets assigned to meet the IP addressing needs of other products, such as bare metal server and virtual server instances. These subnets are automatically assigned and removed. Secondary subnets are subnets which are purchased and routed by you, cancelled when no longer needed. There are two types: portable and static. Portable IP addresses are available to all resources on a VLAN, whereas static IP addresses are available to the resource identified as their routing endpoint. Global IP addresses's unique routing behavior utilizes IBM's Cloud backbone to provide IP addresses to the resources identified as the routing endpoint. Cloud connections and VPN connections were introduced earlier in Part 5, but options around how they are provisioned and added to a PowerVS instance will be explored more deeply in this chapter.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Part%206/02%20ServerPlacementGroups/","text":"Server placement groups provide control over the host or server on which a new instance is placed. By using server placement groups, high availability within a data center can be achieved. When a placement group is set with an affinity policy, all instances in that placement group are launched on the same physical server. When a placement group is set with an anti-affinity policy, all instances in that placement group are launched on different servers. A few facts about server placement groups: By default, there is a maximum of 25 server placement groups. A support ticket needs to be raised to go beyond this limit. The IBM Cloud Portal for server placement groups can only be used if the cloud account has less than 100 instances. If the account has > 100 instances, the command line interfaces (CLI) or application programming interfaces (API) must be used to create server placement groups.

Every instance consists of a boot volume and optionally additional storage volumes. While IBM manages the underlying physical storage, it is the client's responsibility to manage and protect the data on instances. A few facts about storage volumes: Storage volumes can be increased in size in 1GB increments, but not decreased. Storage volume sizes maximums will depend on availability within the selected IBM datacenter. Storage volumes can be marked as shareable . Storage volumes can be marked as bootable . Affinity and anti-affinity rules can be applied to storage volumes. A few facts about boot volumes/images: Boot volumes can be imported from IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS). Boot volumes can be exported to IBM COS. Affinity and anti-affinity rules can be applied to boot volumes. Boot volumes (and storage volumes) of running instances can be captured (also know as a snapshot) to either the local image catalog associated with the PowerVS service or to IBM COS. Captured boot images can be used to provision new instances. In the TechZone environment: Explore the Storage volumes page in the IBM Cloud Portal.

IBM Power Systems Virtual Server provides command line interfaces (CLI) as a plugin to the IBM Cloud CLI. The PowerVS CLIs provide system administrators the ability to programmatically manage their PowerVS environment without having to use the IBM Cloud Portal. In this chapter, explore a variety of CLI instructions that can be issued via the IBM Cloud Shell portal (or any SSH connection) for administration of a PowerVS instance. Topics include: Inspection of all PowerVS services provisioned Setting the service target of the IBM Cloud Shell to the instance ID of the PowerVS environment Setting the target of future PowerVS plugin commands to an environment variable Inspection of the four virtual machines (VMs) provisioned as part of the PowerVS environment, including AIX and RHEL Restarting a virtual machine programmatically Generating an SSH private key for managing the PowerVS environment There are hundreds of potential CLI instructions which can be issued \u2014 our goal is not to be exhaustive and not go into every command in detail, but rather provide a representative sampling of jobs that can be performed programmatically via the CLI.

It is important to remember this is a shared environment and only limited administrative permissions are provided. The CLIs being executed here are commands that only require \"read\" access to the environment. CLIs also exist to create and modify PowerVS resources, but in this shared environment users do not have sufficient permissions to execute those commands. Attempting to do so will result in an error. For this exercise, the IBM Cloud Shell will be used. IBM Cloud Shell gives users complete control of their cloud resources, applications and infrastructure, from any web browser. IBM Cloud Shell provides pre-authenticated access to the latest tools and programming languages for cloud-based development, deployment and management of services and applications \u2014 all in a secure shell. IBM Cloud Shell is instantly accessible from the IBM Cloud portal. The IBM command line interface (CLI) along with all the IBM Cloud CLI plugins are pre-installed in IBM Cloud Shell, including the PowerVS CLIs. It is also possible to install the IBM Cloud CLIs and PowerVS CLI plugin on other systems, like personal desktops, development servers, etc. To learn more about installing the PowerVS CLI locally click here . To get started, first open the IBM Cloud Shell from the IBM Cloud portal: If not already opened, open the IBM Cloud Portal: https://cloud.ibm.com/ and authenticate with your IBM Cloud credentials. Change to the 2305900 - ITZ - ADHOC03 account. Tip If the browser window is narrow, this icon: may be seen instead of the current account name as shown in the screen capture above. Click the IBM Cloud Shell icon . The next steps are performed in using the IBM Cloud Shell window that was opened. First, create a SSH private key file using the key provided in the IBM Technology Zone's reservation welcome e-mail. Remember, to avoid typographical errors copy the command line using the icon when it is available. Then paste the contents into the IBM Cloud Shell using Ctrl +v , Cmd +v , or right click and select paste at the prompt in the IBM Cloud Shell. Display all the PowerVS plugin command line options. ibmcloud pi --help | more Tip for novice Linux users! Those not familiar with Linux commands, don't worry. The above command is actually 2 commands. The first is ibmcloud pi --help . This executes the help option of the PowerVS plugin. The second command is the more command which pauses the output being displayed. The \"|\" or pipe character takes the output from the first command and sends it as input to the second command. To learn more about Linux commands do an Internet search on Linux primer . Press the space bar to continue the output. Continue to press space bar several times to scroll through the complete output. Notice the last part of the message says: Enter 'ibmcloud pi help [command]' for more information about a command. Use this to get more help on individual PowerVS plugin commands. List all the PowerVS services provisioned in the account. ibmcloud pi service-list Sample output To view the PowerVS instances in the service, the service target must first be set for the PowerVS plugin. Set the service target using the instance ID of the service. serviceID=`ibmcloud pi service-list 2>&1 | tail -1 | cut -f1 -d' '` Tip for novice Linux users! The last command did 4 actions. First, it listed the service list like in step 6 and redirected both the error and standard output to the standard output stream ( 2>&1 ). This output was then sent to the tail command which ignores everything but the last line ( -1 ). Then the output from the tail command is sent to the cut command where all the output except the first field up to to the first space character is ignored ( -f -d' ' ). And finally, the output from the cut command was stored in an environment variable called serviceID . Why did we do this? Because no one wants to type crn:v1:bluemix:public:power-iaas:us-south:a/ba0e33c9056f470ca19de009747ec654:c8bee9ba-f208-442c-9e10-5633624d633f:: in order to run the next command. Use the $serviceID environment variable to set the target of future PowerVS plugin commands to the service. ibmcloud pi service-target $serviceID Sample output List all the PowerVS instances provisioned in the targeted PowerVS service. ibmcloud pi instances Sample output View the details of the AIX-vm-1 instance. ibmcloud pi instance AIX-vm-1 Sample output Thus far, all of these commands have been read commands. The PowerVS CLIs also support create and update commands, but remember that user IDs have limited access in this shared environment. Try the instance modify command and see what happens. Hint : Business Partners should record the value of the Storage Pool Affinity field in the output from the above command. Recall that our Power environment consists of a total of 4 PowerVM instances: AIX-vm-1, AIX-vm-2, RH-vm-1, and RH-vm2. Up until now we've primarily been issuing instructions to perform work against AIX-vm-1. Given that the testing environment is primarily limited to read-only actions, let's inspect one of the other VMs and determine what (if any) differences exist between the various instances. Issue the following command to the IBM Cloud Shell: ibmcloud pi instance RH-vm-1 And then issue a second command: ibmcloud pi instance AIX-vm-1 Notice that the two tables are nearly identical, save for a single field at the bottom of the AIX-vm-1 inspection output. There are numerous reasons why one might want to generate an SSH private key for managing a PowerVS environment. In fact, that's exactly what the service's administrators did in order to authorize access to the PowerVS instance \u2014 recall first connecting to the PowerVS virtual machines remotely via the IBM Cloud Shell with the supplied key information. The IBM Cloud Shell is capable of generating an SSH key that is configured for password-less authentication (in other words, allowing users to authenticate without needing to also supply a password). This can be done using IBM Cloud Shell, or any Linux environment, using the following ssh-keygen command: ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N '' -f newKey Sample output Use the PowerVS CLIs to create a key for the instance using an imported RSA public key. Specify the key pair generated above as the source (newKey). Do so using the following command. (Note: newKeyPOWER is the name of the IBM Power CLI-generated key that is to be created; newKey is the SSH key generated earlier using the IBM Cloud Shell). SSH keys Be aware that the SSH key-pair generated and assigned by this step is specific to IBM Power Systems. These are distinct from ones generated previously using the IBM Cloud Shell. ibmcloud pi keyc newKeyPOWER --key newKey Sample output As expected, the instruction fails to execute because of insufficient (locked down) permissions within this testing environment. Next, experiment with other IBM Power CLIs. Many instructions and commands will meet with similar results, but it nevertheless is good practice given that there is no risk to the system within this sandbox environment. Restart the RH-vm-1 instance. ibmcloud pi instance-soft-reboot RH-vm-1 Sample output Note, an enhancement request has been submitted to improve the CLI error messages. There are over 100 PowerVS CLIs. Feel free to explore these using the TechZone environment. Remember, use ibmcloud pi --help or ibmcloud pi <command> --help to get detailed information on a command's usage.
